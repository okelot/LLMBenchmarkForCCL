The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Nisga'a had a right to occupy their lands and that the Crown's actions in issuing permits and licenses to log and mine the lands were unlawful.","Did the Nisga'a have title to their traditional lands, and if so, had such title been extinguished by the Crown?","The Supreme Court of Canada held that the Nisga'a did have title to their traditional lands, but that such title had been extinguished by the Crown prior to the issuance of permits and licenses to log and mine the lands. However, the Court also held that the Nisga'a had a right to compensation for the loss of their lands.","The Court held that the Nisga'a had title to their traditional lands based on their historical occupation and use of the lands. However, the Court also found that the Crown had extinguished the Nisga'a title through a series of legislative and administrative actions, including the establishment of the Colony of British Columbia and the issuance of permits and licenses to log and mine the lands.","The ratio decidendi of the case is that Indigenous title to traditional lands can be established through historical occupation and use, but that such title can be extinguished by the Crown through clear and plain legislative or administrative action.","The appellants are representative of the Nishga Tribe of British Columbia.  They claim that the aboriginal title over a piece of land in British Columbia that had been present before Confederation had never been extinguished, and that the tribe therefore still had title to the land.  This claim was denied at trial and upheld at appeal.","Do the alleged aboriginal land claims exist?
If the claims exist, were they extinguished?",Appeal dismissed.,"At trial and upon initial appeal the courts decided that if there ever was aboriginal title, it was surely extinguished upon confederation.  The Supreme Court holds that aboriginal title definitely exists, however they were split over whether or not it had been extinguished.  The majority decided that it has been extinguished by virtue of the government's exercise of control over the lands, and therefore the appeal is dismissed.  However, the dissenting judges disagree and state that more must be present to prove that the lands were extinguished.  They say that the provincial government did not have any constitutional right to deal with the land of the aboriginals, and that their predecessors before confederation did not do anything that could amount to extinguishing the lands.","Recognition of aboriginal title.

The court also emphasized the importance of protecting the rights and autonomy of individuals with disabilities.","The court established that non-therapeutic sterilization of a mentally disabled person without their consent is not in their best interests and is a violation of their rights to autonomy, dignity, and bodily integrity.","Eve was a 24 year-old mentally disabled woman living in PEI with a condition that made it very difficult for her to communicate with others.  She was sent away from her mother, who cared for her, during the week so that she could attend a special school.  Her mother was seeking the court's permission to perform a sterilization procedure (hysterectomy) on her daughter.  There was considerable evidence that the daughter would be incapable of handling the burdens of motherhood.  Eve had struck up a friendship with a boy from school, and discussed marriage, and her mother is afraid of the burden that would be placed on Eve, and ultimately upon herself to look after a child if pregnancy ensued.  Permission was denied at trial, but granted at the Court of Appeal.",Can a caregiver for someone incapable of giving informed consent make decisions about surgeries for the incapable individual?,Appeal allowed.,"La Forest, writing for a unanimous court, discusses the history of
parens patriae
jurisdiction, which states that the state is responsible for decisions concerning those that cannot give informed consent themselves. He says that the test is generally that the only procedures that will be allowed are ones that are in the ""best interests"" of the protected person. He focuses his criticism in this case on the fact that Mrs. E. is claiming that the burden on her to look after the child should be considered in making the decision. La Forest states that this should be given no consideration, as it is only the best interests of the protected person that are of concern.
He also says that arguing about the protected person's fitness as a parents involves value-loaded questions that result in a designation of disabled persons as less competent parents, even though there is significant evidence showing that they show as much fondness and concern for their children as anyone else. He also considers that the procedure of a hysterectomy is serious surgery and quite invasive, and further that Eve does not require assistance caring for her reproductive cycle, which is a concern in other cases. Perhaps most importantly, this surgery is not therapeutic.
La Forest concludes that ""the grave intrusion on a person’s rights and the certain physical damage that ensues from non-therapeutic sterilization without consent, when compared to the highly questionable advantages that can result, [show that] it can never safely be determined that such a procedure is for the benefit of the person."" The procedure should never be authorized for non-therapeutic purposes under the
parens patriae
jurisdiction.","Non-therapeutic surgeries can never be determined to be for the benefit of a person who is incapable of giving informed consent.
It is only the best interests of the disabled person concerned that are of importance; concerns of others should not be considered."

He filed a complaint with the Council of Human Rights alleging discrimination based on his disability.,Whether the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles' decision to deny Grismer a driver's license constituted discrimination under the Human Rights Code.,The court held that the Superintendent's decision was discriminatory and that Grismer's rights under the Human Rights Code had been infringed.,The court found that the Superintendent had not established that the visual standards for obtaining a driver's license were a bona fide occupational requirement. The court also found that the Superintendent had not provided sufficient evidence to justify the denial of Grismer's license application.,The decision established that a service provider must provide reasonable accommodation to individuals with disabilities unless it can be shown that doing so would cause undue hardship.,"The Government of British Columbia had a policy stating that it would not issue licenses to people suffering from a condition (homonymous hemianopsia (HH)) which affected eyesight.  The claimant had this condition but had driven flawlessly at work and on public roads using ""prism glasses"".  Despite this he was refused individual assessment and was not allowed to receive a license and was therefore unable to complete his job.  The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal allowed Grismer to be individually tested.  Grismer died shortly after this decision.  This was upheld by the British Columbia Supreme Court but overruled by the Court of Appeal.",Does an absolute prohibition on licensing people with a visual impairment without the possibility of individual assessment constitute discrimination?,"Appeal allowed, standard disallowed.","The court applies the
Meiorin
test, showing that it can be used in scenarios outside of the workplace to determine if discrimination is justified.  This case passes the first part because the purpose of the standard (reasonable safety) is rationally connected to the function (issuing drivers’ licenses).  It also passes the second step because there is no evidence that the standard (no licenses for HH sufferers) was adopted for any reasons other than road safety.  However the case fails the third step as the court finds that the standard (no licenses for HH) is not reasonably necessary for the purpose (reasonable safety).  The blanket prohibition doesn't let people even attempt to show that they can drive safely.
It is clear here that the accommodation would be to allow testing.  In order to succeed the government would have had to prove that to allow testing would result to undue hardship which they failed to do.  Although there are clearly safety and cost concerns involved with testing, the government didn't put in any effort to determine these values, nor did they even look for alternative ways of testing.  The court also says that in general, with the government, costs must be exorbitant to amount to undue hardship, as they are publicly funded and this would be seen as being in the public interest.  As the standard is not rationally necessary for the purpose of reasonable road safety, it amounts to discrimination and must be removed.","The
Meiorin
test applies to all standards that are thought to be discriminatory, even if they do not occur in a workplace; called bona fide justification tests.
The government will be held to a very high threshold when claiming that the costs of not adopting a standard amount to undue hardship as they are publicly funded and preventing discrimination is in the public interest."

His employment contract included a clause that limited his entitlement to notice of termination to the minimum required by the Employment Standards Act (ESA). When Machtinger was terminated, he received the minimum notice required by the ESA, but he claimed that he was entitled to reasonable notice at common law.","Was the termination clause in Machtinger's employment contract enforceable, or was he entitled to reasonable notice at common law?","The Supreme Court of Canada held that the termination clause was not enforceable, and Machtinger was entitled to reasonable notice at common law.","The court found that the termination clause was ambiguous and did not clearly exclude Machtinger's entitlement to reasonable notice at common law. The court also held that the ESA was intended to provide a minimum standard for employment contracts, and that employers could not contract out of the requirement to provide reasonable notice.","An employment contract must clearly and unambiguously exclude an employee's entitlement to reasonable notice at common law in order to be enforceable. If the contract is ambiguous, the employee will be entitled to reasonable notice at common law.","Both appellants began working for HOJ Industries, a car dealer, in 1978, and were discharged in 1985 without cause.  At the time they were dismissed Machtinger was credit manager and rust‑proofing sales manager and Lefebvre was sales manager.  Each had entered into a contract for employment for an indefinite period which contained a clause allowing the respondent to terminate his employment without cause, in Machtinger's case without notice and in Lefebvre's case on two weeks' notice.  Under the provincial
Employment Standards Act
the appellants were entitled to a minimum notice period of four weeks.  After they were dismissed, the respondent paid each of them the equivalent of four weeks' salary.  The appellants brought action for wrongful dismissal and the trial judge found that they were entitled to reasonable notice of termination, and that the period of reasonable notice for Machtinger was 7 months and for Lefebvre, 7½ months, however this was overturned by the Court of Appeal.",What should the notice period be in order to terminate employment if notice required in employment contract violates legislated standards?,"Appeal allowed, lower court judgment restored.","McLachlin, writing a concurring judgment, examined the legal principles governing the implication of terms.

She finds that the Court of Appeal erred in characterizing a term implied in law as a term implied in fact, which brought in the intentionality of the parties.

On consent, SM was made a ward of the society 1989. Throughout the wardship, the society continued to work with CM and facilitated regular visits with SM, however, bonding between mother and daughter remained minimal. In December 1989, after a second four-month wardship, the society brought a status review application seeking an order of Crown wardship without access for the purposes of adoption. CM opposed the motion and the matter was dealt with sporadically throughout 1991. In February 1992 the Ontario Provincial Court ordered that SM be returned to CM on the basis that court intervention was no longer necessary to protect the child. The judge considered CM capable of acquiring the skill to care for her daughter adequately. The society obtained a stay of the order and unsuccessfully appealed to the Ontario Court (General Division). The Court of Appeal granted a stay of the order for return pending appeal and a motion for the introduction of fresh evidence. The new evidence concerned the consistent and repeated assertions of the child that she regarded her foster family as her real family, that she did not want to see her birth mother and that attempts to implement access visits with CM had become almost impossible because of the child's negative reactions - emotional, psychological and physical.  It allowed the appeal, set aside the order for the return of the child to the mother and ordered that the child be made a Crown ward without access for the purposes of adoption. CM appealed to the Supreme Court.",Does the child need continued protection?,Appeal dismissed.,"L'Heureux-Dubé, writing for the court, reviewed the case law and determined that when a court is determining whether the wardship should be terminated or continue, the judge should not determine whether an order of wardship should have been made in the previous or earlier hearings, but instead
now
consider whether continuation of the wardship in the current proceedings is in the best interests of the child without overlooking the parents' rights.  The review hearing is not about retrying the original need for a protection order, but rather the court should determine the circumstances of the parents or parent since the last order as it relates to the situation with respect to the child's custody, including their physical, mental and emotional state since that time and also whether there is now a lifestyle, including attitudes of the parent, that warrants the child being returned to the parent or to wardship.
She lays out a two part test:
Does the child continue to need protection and require a court order for protection?
The children's aid society must continue to justify its intervention by showing that a court order is necessary to protect the child in the future.  This does not mean that an absence of proof of a deficiency in the parent's parenting capacity is enough to return the child to the parent.  A court order may be necessary to protect the child from emotional harm which would result in future if the child were taken from its psychological parents.
What is in the best interests of the children?
This should be decided through a balancing of the considerations such as the importance of the continuity of care, the child’s physical/emotional/psychological needs, the benefit of a child's bond to his/her biological parent, as well as psychological bonding of child to his/her foster family.
The furtherance and protection of the child’s best interests must take priority over the desires and interests of the parent.
The question is not merely whether the parent has seen the light and is now prepared to be a good parent, but whether or not the parent has, in factk turned a new leaf and whether he or she is now able to give to the children the care they require?

: was the agreement ""unimpeachably negotiated""?

duration of negotiations: was the agreement negotiated over a reasonable amount of time?

Generally, where negotiation of the agreement was correct and the agreement remains in substantial compliance with the
Act
, the court should defer to the wishes of the party and accord the agreement great weight.
Applying this to the case at bar:
Both parties had engaged the services of expert counsel and negotiations persisted over a lengthy period. Although the husband may have been the dominant party, the wife had adequate counsel; there was no hint of any vulnerabilities that might not be compensated by counsel.
The quantum of child support established in the agreement intended to provide the wife with a minimum amount of income in contemplation of her not working. While the wife argues that the business generates income, this was accounted for when the assets were valued and divided. The consulting contract reflects the parties' intention to provide the wife with a source of employment income for a limited time. The wife chose not to go back to the workforce, and had substantial assets even without support; there was no hardship or long-term disadvantage.
In the result, the original order should stand.
LeBel and Deschamps, in the dissent, stress very different concepts: interdependence and unequal bargaining power.  They propose a simpler test; is the agreement objectively unfair when considered now?
The dissenters disagree with the majority in two key areas.  One, the presence of counsel may not be enough to negate a power imbalance, and two, that very little deference should be given to agreements that deviate from the objectives in
s. 15.2(6)

They employ the
Kamloops
test to determine if a duty of care should be owed.  It has two parts:
Is the relationship between the two parties close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there any public policy implications that should negate or limit the scope of the duty?
They find that the first part is satisfied; however the public policy implications negate the duty.  They state that there are two main reasons for this: it would violate the privacy and autonomy of women, and it is impossible to judicially define a reasonable standard of conduct for pregnant women.
McLachlin, in a concurring judgment, states that another main reason why this duty cannot be imposed is that it would violate pregnant women's rights under the
Charter
– specifically liberty and equality.  They would lose their liberty, and not be treated equally with other women in society.
Major, in the dissent, states that in order for the public policy implications to negate the duty they must add new restrictions on what the woman can do.  He says that this is not the case, because she had a duty of care to everyone else on the road, and extending that to the foetus would not change the reasonable standard of her conduct.  He says that this case deals specifically with pregnant women driving automobiles, and if the creation of duty imposed a limitation on her actions that was not there previously then the outcome would be different.  He uses the example with another pregnant woman in the car – if the same outcome occurred, then there is no question that the other woman's foetus could sue her for negligence.  He agrees that the
Kamloops
test applies, but says that the policy implications here do not negate the duty.","Pregnant women do not owe a duty of care to the foetus in their womb.
The test to determine if a duty of care is owed has two parts:
Is the relationship close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there public policy grounds to negate or limit the scope of the duty?

The court weighed the provincial government's interests against the appellants' rights, ultimately determining that the law did not adequately consider the unique circumstances of the appellants and their specific treaty obligations.",Provincial laws impacting Aboriginal rights must be consistent with existing treaty rights and adequately address the unique circumstances of affected First Nations communities.,"The appellants are representative of the Nishga Tribe of British Columbia.  They claim that the aboriginal title over a piece of land in British Columbia that had been present before Confederation had never been extinguished, and that the tribe therefore still had title to the land.  This claim was denied at trial and upheld at appeal.","Do the alleged aboriginal land claims exist?
If the claims exist, were they extinguished?",Appeal dismissed.,"At trial and upon initial appeal the courts decided that if there ever was aboriginal title, it was surely extinguished upon confederation.  The Supreme Court holds that aboriginal title definitely exists, however they were split over whether or not it had been extinguished.  The majority decided that it has been extinguished by virtue of the government's exercise of control over the lands, and therefore the appeal is dismissed.  However, the dissenting judges disagree and state that more must be present to prove that the lands were extinguished.  They say that the provincial government did not have any constitutional right to deal with the land of the aboriginals, and that their predecessors before confederation did not do anything that could amount to extinguishing the lands.","Recognition of aboriginal title.

OPENAI.gpt-4o,E. (Mrs.) v Eve,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,"Eve was a 24 year-old mentally disabled woman living in PEI with a condition that made it very difficult for her to communicate with others.  She was sent away from her mother, who cared for her, during the week so that she could attend a special school.  Her mother was seeking the court's permission to perform a sterilization procedure (hysterectomy) on her daughter.  There was considerable evidence that the daughter would be incapable of handling the burdens of motherhood.  Eve had struck up a friendship with a boy from school, and discussed marriage, and her mother is afraid of the burden that would be placed on Eve, and ultimately upon herself to look after a child if pregnancy ensued.  Permission was denied at trial, but granted at the Court of Appeal.",Can a caregiver for someone incapable of giving informed consent make decisions about surgeries for the incapable individual?,Appeal allowed.,"La Forest, writing for a unanimous court, discusses the history of
parens patriae
jurisdiction, which states that the state is responsible for decisions concerning those that cannot give informed consent themselves. He says that the test is generally that the only procedures that will be allowed are ones that are in the ""best interests"" of the protected person. He focuses his criticism in this case on the fact that Mrs. E. is claiming that the burden on her to look after the child should be considered in making the decision. La Forest states that this should be given no consideration, as it is only the best interests of the protected person that are of concern.
He also says that arguing about the protected person's fitness as a parents involves value-loaded questions that result in a designation of disabled persons as less competent parents, even though there is significant evidence showing that they show as much fondness and concern for their children as anyone else. He also considers that the procedure of a hysterectomy is serious surgery and quite invasive, and further that Eve does not require assistance caring for her reproductive cycle, which is a concern in other cases. Perhaps most importantly, this surgery is not therapeutic.
La Forest concludes that ""the grave intrusion on a person’s rights and the certain physical damage that ensues from non-therapeutic sterilization without consent, when compared to the highly questionable advantages that can result, [show that] it can never safely be determined that such a procedure is for the benefit of the person."" The procedure should never be authorized for non-therapeutic purposes under the
parens patriae
jurisdiction.","Non-therapeutic surgeries can never be determined to be for the benefit of a person who is incapable of giving informed consent.
It is only the best interests of the disabled person concerned that are of importance; concerns of others should not be considered."

The B.C.G.S.E.U. argued that this requirement was discriminatory against women.  The B.C. government argued that the physical requirements were job-related and demonstrably necessary. The case involved male and female applicants and their ability to satisfy the required physical standards.,"Whether the physical ability test for firefighters, which excluded a disproportionate number of women, was discriminatory.",The court found the physical ability test to be discriminatory.,"The court, applying the four-part test (sometimes referred to as the ""O'Malley test"") for evaluating discrimination cases, found that while the physical requirements were job-related, they were not demonstrably necessary. The test excluded a disproportionate number of women, and alternative standards that would not exclude women were available. The court recognized that physical strength was a relevant criterion, but the specific test in question was not narrowly tailored to ensuring safety standards.","In cases where a requirement has a disparate impact on a protected group, the employer must demonstrate that the requirement is job-related and demonstrably necessary.  While a physical ability requirement can be valid in certain circumstances, employers cannot adopt tests or criteria if demonstrably less restrictive alternatives are available that don't exclude a disproportionate number of members of a protected group.",,,,,

Highway Traffic Act
(now
s. 188
) which prohibited driving ""on a highway without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway"". The defendant challenged the law, claiming that it was beyond the power of the province because the federal government had ""occupied the field"" with a similar criminal provision in ss. 191/221 (now
s. 219
) of the
Criminal Code
, which prohibited driving with ""wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons"".  O'Grady was convicted at trial and an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba was dismissed.","Are provincial laws relating to negligence with penal consequences criminal law and therefore
ultra vires
the province?",Appeal dismissed.,"Judson, writing for the majority, held that ""the power of a provincial legislature to enact legislation for the regulation of highway traffic is undoubted"".  He reaffirmed the principle that there exists a ""general area"" or ""domain"" of criminal law and the two governments can make law on the same matter by creating a distinction between the types of culpability.  He quotes from Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law:
There are only two states of mind which constitute
mens rea
, and they are intention and recklessness. The difference between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; they are opposed and it is a logical fallacy to suggest that recklessness is a degree of negligence. The common habit of lawyers to qualify the word ""negligence"" with some moral epithet such as ""wicked"", ""gross"", or ""culpable"" has been most unfortunate since it has inevitably led to great confusion of thought and of principle. It is equally misleading to speak of criminal negligence since this is merely to use an expression to explain itself.
On the facts, Judson found that there was overlap between the laws however ""there is no conflict between these provisions in the sense that they are repugnant"". The provincial law extended to include ""inadvertent negligence"" as well as regular negligence. It was enough that “the two pieces of legislation differed both in legislative purpose and legal and practical effect” to justify both of them.","The distinction between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; recklessness is when an actor does not desire harmful consequences but forsees the possibility and consciously takes the risk.
There must be an operational incompatibility between federal and provincial law to invoke paramountcy."
OPENAI.gpt-4o,Canada (Attorney General) v Mossup,"The case involved a challenge to the constitutionality of a provision of the Canada Elections Act that allowed for the disqualification of a candidate for certain offences.  The specific facts and the nature of the offences are not provided in this summary.  The challenged provision related to conduct during election campaigns, potentially encompassing various types of infractions.","Whether the provision of the Canada Elections Act, which allowed for the disqualification of a candidate for certain offences, was a valid exercise of Parliament's power under the Constitution Act, 1867?",The Court of Appeal held that the provision was unconstitutional.,"The Court of Appeal found that the provision infringed upon the right to run for office, a fundamental aspect of democratic participation. The decision focused on the balance between the state's interest in ensuring fair elections and the individual's right to be a candidate. The specific arguments and reasoning related to the challenged offences are not detailed here.","A provision in an electoral law that disqualifies a candidate for certain offences must be demonstrably justified to be considered constitutional.  The impugned provision in this case failed to meet this requirement, as it did not sufficiently demonstrate that the particular offences were directly related to the integrity and fairness of the electoral process. The infringement on the right to run for office, a fundamental aspect of democracy, was not outweighed by the state's interest in upholding electoral standards.","Mossop is a gay man, and his partner's father died.  He applied to take bereavement leave from his job to go to the funeral, but is denied because his partner is neither a ""spouse"" nor a ""common law partner"" as they are both required to be of the opposite sex.  He makes a claim to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, but refuses to argue sexual orientation as a ground, and instead will only argue family status, stating that all matters to do with homosexuals are not about sexual orientation by definition.  The case was dismissed in the lower courts.","Can a homosexual man claim discrimination against ""family status"" with his partner under

However, Mossop sticks with family status.  The majority says that you cannot interpret ""family status"" to include Mossop’s situation unless you also discuss the ground of sexual orientation, and as Mossop refuses to do so he cannot be successful.
La Forest
concurs, but instead looks to the definitions in the Act and tries to figure out what the government meant to protect under ""family status"".  He determines that this specific field was not intended to be covered.
In the dissent,
L'Heureux-Dubé
says that ""family status"" should have a very broad interpretation.  She looks to the broader social context of limiting it as the majority does, and further that by looking at the plain meaning given in the statute you are really just taking the majority's opinion of the definition, which is exactly what you try to avoid in human rights issues.  She also suggests that when there are overlapping grounds, you should select the one that will succeed and proceed with that one.","Only identified grounds can be pursued in a human rights claim.
Definitions in human rights legislation are generally interpreted broadly, but the definition given by Parliament in the statute has a good deal of authority in the court's decision on what falls under the definition and what does not."
OPENAI.gpt-4o,British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v British Columbia (Council of Human Rights) (Re Grismer Estate),"The estate of a deceased driver, Mr. Grismer, sought to have a restriction on his driver's license lifted.  The restriction, imposed due to medical reasons, was upheld by the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles.  The estate argued that the restriction violated Mr. Grismer's right to equality under the provincial human rights code. The Council of Human Rights found in favor of the estate, concluding the restriction was discriminatory.","Was the restriction on Mr. Grismer's driver's license, imposed due to medical reasons, discriminatory and in violation of the provincial human rights code?","The Supreme Court of British Columbia upheld the decision of the Council of Human Rights, finding the restriction to be discriminatory.","The court reasoned that the restriction, while seemingly based on a legitimate objective (public safety), was not rationally connected to that objective. The evidence presented didn't establish a direct link between the nature of Mr. Grismer's medical condition and an inability to safely operate a motor vehicle.  Additionally, the court considered that the restriction disproportionately affected Mr. Grismer, and alternatives that would have allowed for a return to driving were not explored.",A restriction on a driver's license based on medical grounds is discriminatory and in violation of human rights legislation if the restriction is not rationally connected to public safety and if there are reasonable alternatives that would allow for safe operation of a motor vehicle.,"The Government of British Columbia had a policy stating that it would not issue licenses to people suffering from a condition (homonymous hemianopsia (HH)) which affected eyesight.  The claimant had this condition but had driven flawlessly at work and on public roads using ""prism glasses"".  Despite this he was refused individual assessment and was not allowed to receive a license and was therefore unable to complete his job.  The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal allowed Grismer to be individually tested.  Grismer died shortly after this decision.  This was upheld by the British Columbia Supreme Court but overruled by the Court of Appeal.",Does an absolute prohibition on licensing people with a visual impairment without the possibility of individual assessment constitute discrimination?,"Appeal allowed, standard disallowed.","The court applies the
Meiorin
test, showing that it can be used in scenarios outside of the workplace to determine if discrimination is justified.  This case passes the first part because the purpose of the standard (reasonable safety) is rationally connected to the function (issuing drivers’ licenses).  It also passes the second step because there is no evidence that the standard (no licenses for HH sufferers) was adopted for any reasons other than road safety.  However the case fails the third step as the court finds that the standard (no licenses for HH) is not reasonably necessary for the purpose (reasonable safety).  The blanket prohibition doesn't let people even attempt to show that they can drive safely.
It is clear here that the accommodation would be to allow testing.  In order to succeed the government would have had to prove that to allow testing would result to undue hardship which they failed to do.  Although there are clearly safety and cost concerns involved with testing, the government didn't put in any effort to determine these values, nor did they even look for alternative ways of testing.  The court also says that in general, with the government, costs must be exorbitant to amount to undue hardship, as they are publicly funded and this would be seen as being in the public interest.  As the standard is not rationally necessary for the purpose of reasonable road safety, it amounts to discrimination and must be removed.","The
Meiorin
test applies to all standards that are thought to be discriminatory, even if they do not occur in a workplace; called bona fide justification tests.
The government will be held to a very high threshold when claiming that the costs of not adopting a standard amount to undue hardship as they are publicly funded and preventing discrimination is in the public interest."
OPENAI.gpt-4o,Just v British Columbia,"A dispute arose between the plaintiff, Just, and British Columbia regarding a land claim.  Specific details of the land, the nature of the claim, and the relevant legislation are not provided in the prompt.",The specific legal issue(s) in the case *Just v. British Columbia* are not stated in the prompt.,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,"Heavy snow fall forced Just and his daughter to stop in a line of traffic by a rocky slope on a major highway.  A boulder, which worked loose from the wooded slopes above the highway, came crashing down on the appellant's car, killing the appellant's daughter and causing him very serious injuries.  Just brought an action against the provincial government contending that the government negligently failed to properly maintain the highway.
The Department of Highways had set up a system for inspection and remedial work upon rock slopes.  Inspection and recommendations were made by engineers and the work was effected by a rock scaling crew responsible for performing remedial work throughout the entire province.  The department's practice had been to make visual inspections from the highway unless rock falls or a history of instability in an area indicated a need for the rock engineer to climb the slope.  Numerous informal inspections were carried out by highway personnel as they drove along the road.
The trial judge found that the entire system of inspection and the way it was implemented was a policy matter which did not give rise to liability. No finding was made as to whether or not the system of inspection was reasonable or whether the inspections themselves were properly carried out. The Court of Appeal upheld the finding of the trial judge and Just appealled to the Supreme Court.","Is the government under a duty of care to maintain the highways and if so, are they liable if the highways are not sufficiently maintained?","Appeal allowed, new trial ordered.","Cory, writing for the majority, held that the province owes a duty of care, which ordinarily extends to their reasonable maintenance, to those using its highways.  The Department of Highways could readily foresee the risk that harm might befall users of a highway if it were not reasonably maintained.  That maintenance could be found to extend to the prevention of injury from falling rock.
Government agencies may be exempt from the application of the traditional tort law duty of care if an explicit statutory exemption exists or if the decision arose as a result of a policy decision.  Whether or not a decision is characterized as a policy decision or as an operational decision rests on the nature of the decision and not on the identity of the actors.  Generally, decisions concerning budgetary allotments for departments or government agencies should be classified as policy decisions.  A policy decision may be open to challenge on the basis that it is not made in the bona fide exercise of discretion.  If after due consideration it is found that a duty of care is owed by the government agency and no exemption by way of statute or policy decision-making is found to exist, a traditional torts analysis ensues (as per
Anns v Merton London Borough Council
) and the issue of standard of care required of the government agency must next be considered.  The manner and quality of an inspection system, since it was clearly part of the operational aspect of a governmental activity, should be assessed when consideration is given to the standard of care issue.  At this stage, the requisite standard of care must be assessed in light of all the surrounding circumstances including budgetary restraints and the availability of qualified personnel and equipment.
Sopinka, in the dissent, held that the government had the power to carry out the inspections but was under no duty to do so.  Conduct within the limits of this discretion gives rise to no duty of care; conduct outside of these limits may attract a private law duty of care.
A litigant may not attack a policy and it is not appropriate for a Court to pass on it, absent evidence that a policy was adopted for some ulterior motive and not for a municipal purpose.  In order for a private duty to arise, it would have to be shown that the Rockwork Section acted outside its delegated discretion to determine whether to inspect and the manner in which the inspection is to be made.  Policy decisions are immune from review because they usually entail not only a decision to do something but also some call upon the public purse.  The government was acting within its discretion when it decided that inspections should be done and the manner in which they were to be done.  Responsibility for deciding the extent to which the inspection program was to be implemented was delegated to the Rockwork Section.","The duty of care should apply to a public authority unless there is a valid basis for its exclusion.
Policy decisions – the decision by the government about what acts to perform under a given statute – are exempt from liability; operational decisions – the decision by the government about how to perform those acts once they have been decided - are not exempt from liability."
OPENAI.gpt-4o,Machtinger v HOJ Industries Ltd.,"A worker, Machtinger, was employed by HOJ Industries Ltd. He was discharged for alleged misconduct.  The termination procedure did not follow the company's internal disciplinary procedures, which were a part of his employment contract.  The termination was deemed unfair. The employer, HOJ, claimed the internal procedures were not mandatory, and the employee, Machtinger, did not follow the necessary steps outlined within the procedures.","Whether an employer's failure to follow its own internal disciplinary procedures, as part of the employment contract, constitutes a breach of contract justifying wrongful dismissal.","The Court of Appeal found for the employee, Machtinger, and ruled that the dismissal was wrongful.","The Court of Appeal emphasized that the internal disciplinary procedures were an integral part of the employment contract, and failure to follow them constituted a breach of contract. The employer argued that the procedures were not mandatory and thus their non-compliance was not a breach, but the Court found that these procedures did form part of the agreed upon employment terms.  The employer did not establish a valid and fair reason for not following the procedures, and the failure to do so was thus actionable.","An employer's failure to follow its own internal disciplinary procedures, explicitly or implicitly made part of the employment contract, may constitute a breach of contract and lead to a finding of wrongful dismissal. The employer bears the burden of demonstrating a valid reason for not adhering to those procedures.","Both appellants began working for HOJ Industries, a car dealer, in 1978, and were discharged in 1985 without cause.  At the time they were dismissed Machtinger was credit manager and rust‑proofing sales manager and Lefebvre was sales manager.  Each had entered into a contract for employment for an indefinite period which contained a clause allowing the respondent to terminate his employment without cause, in Machtinger's case without notice and in Lefebvre's case on two weeks' notice.  Under the provincial
Employment Standards Act
the appellants were entitled to a minimum notice period of four weeks.  After they were dismissed, the respondent paid each of them the equivalent of four weeks' salary.  The appellants brought action for wrongful dismissal and the trial judge found that they were entitled to reasonable notice of termination, and that the period of reasonable notice for Machtinger was 7 months and for Lefebvre, 7½ months, however this was overturned by the Court of Appeal.",What should the notice period be in order to terminate employment if notice required in employment contract violates legislated standards?,"Appeal allowed, lower court judgment restored.","McLachlin, writing a concurring judgment, examined the legal principles governing the implication of terms.  She identifies three types of implied terms:
terms implied by fact (intention required);
terms implied by law (no intention required); and

and identifies #2 as the type the courts will read into a contract.  Implication of law can be from custom, for business efficiency (what is necessary in a contract), or what is reasonable (from Denning's dissent in
Liverpool City Council v Irwin
).
She finds that the Court of Appeal erred in characterizing a term implied in law as a term implied in fact, which brought in the intentionality of the parties.  Holding that the employer had a legal obligation to provide reasonable notice and that this can only be displaced by an express contrary agreement, the court imposed a reasonable term of notification on HOJ; HOJ industries.","Terms can be implied by the court based on:

OPENAI.gpt-4o,Homex Realty and Development Co. Ltd. v Wyoming (Village),"Homex Realty and Development Co. Ltd. sought to develop a large-scale residential project in the Village of Wyoming.  The Village of Wyoming denied Homex's application for the project, citing concerns about the project's potential impact on the village's infrastructure, water resources, and environmental protection. The denial was based on a variety of local planning regulations.","Whether the Village of Wyoming's denial of Homex Realty's development application was arbitrary and capricious, violating Homex's rights to due process and equal protection.",The decision of the Village of Wyoming was upheld.,"The court found the Village's decision was supported by substantial evidence in the record.  The Village presented evidence demonstrating the potential negative impacts of the project on existing infrastructure, and water resources.  The concerns about environmental protection also played a role in the denial.","Local governments have the right to regulate development within their boundaries, and their decisions regarding development projects will be upheld as long as they are supported by substantial evidence and are not arbitrary or capricious. The court did not find that the Village's denial was motivated by bias or improper considerations.","As a condition of registration of a plan of subdivision in the Village of Wyoming, Atkinson, the owner and subdivider of the parcel of land, entered into an agreement with the Village for the installation of municipal services in the subdivision. This agreement, dated January 22, 1968, and registered September 26, 1975, provided in a general way for the owner's providing ""all the requirements financial and otherwise, of the Corporation re surfacing of roads, installation of services and drainage"". The agreement also prevented the sale of the lands in question until the agreement had been fully carried out, except with the consent of the Village, but the provision did not provide that consent would operate to release Atkinson from his obligation to the Village. Before any services were installed, Homex bought the great majority of the lots on the subdivision with the Village's consent. There was some question as to whether or not Homex had undertaken to assume the obligations of the original subdivider. Nevertheless, when protracted negotiations between the Village and Homex concerning the installation of services proved fruitless, the Village, in April 1976, pursuant to s. 29(3) (now
s. 50(3)
) of the
Planning Act
and without notice to Homex, enacted by-law 7 deeming the lots purchased by Homex not to be a registered plan of subdivision. Homex, in September 1976, made application for judicial review for an order quashing by-law 7 and, while the application was pending, checkerboarded its lots.
In November 1975, Homex and the Village negotiated the installation of services along the only street requiring them. By-law 6, enacted in December 1975, provided that it was the policy of the Village that it would neither assume responsibility for a water pipeline constructed by Homex nor permit its connection to the municipal water supply system. Homex coupled an application in judicial review to quash by-law 6 with the application for an order to quash by-law 7.","What qualifies as a ""legislative"" decision such that no duty of procedural fairness applies?",Appeal dismissed.,"Estey, writing for the majority, held that while the passage of By-law 7 had some characteristics of a community interest, it was also clearly the culmination of the dispute between the village and Homex.  As a result he found that the decision was quasi-judicial such as to attract the principle of notice and the doctrine of
audi alteram partem
.  Despite this, however, he held that the conduct of Homex to rid itself of the obligations under the agreement with Atkinson were such that it should be denied a discretionary remedy.  There was also no basis to challenge By-law 6 as it simply stated the facts of the agreement with Atkinson.
Dickson, in the dissent, is quoted:
The courts long ago developed the general proposition that wherever a statute authorizes the interference with property or other rights and is silent as to whether or not the agency in question is required to give notice prior to the intervention in such rights, the courts will ""supply the omission of the legislature"" and require the agency in question to afford the subject an opportunity of being heard before it proceeds.
He held that an act could not be labelled ""legislative"" merely for the purpose of dispensing with fairness. It was not particularly important that the function of the municipality was classified as ""legislative"" or ""quasi-judicial"", rather, it was necessary to look at the nature of the function and to the facts of each case. The by-law in question was not of wide and general application, but was rather aimed at deliberately limiting the rights of Homex, entitling it to some procedural safeguards - at a minimum, notice of the proposed by-law and the opportunity to be heard.","In general, the courts have not imposed procedural requirements on the subordinate law-making function.
The facts of each case are key to determining the level of procedural fairness required."

The child's parents sought legal action against the Society.",Was the Catholic Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto negligent in its care of the child?,The Court found the Society liable for negligence.,"The Court found that the Society failed to properly monitor and respond to the escalating concerns about the child's well-being.  Specifically, the Society's procedures and practices fell below the standard of care expected of similar organizations, leading to a breach of duty owed to the child. The Court considered the Society's failure to provide adequate mental health support and the lack of timely intervention in addressing the physical deterioration of the child.","Child welfare organizations have a duty of care to children placed in their care, including a duty to monitor their well-being and respond appropriately to emerging concerns. Failure to meet this standard of care, resulting in demonstrable harm to a child, can constitute negligence.  The specific actions of the Society, or lack thereof, in this case fell below the required standard of care.","The aid society took SM into protection on several occasions and supervised her mother, CM, on parenting skills. On consent, SM was made a ward of the society 1989. Throughout the wardship, the society continued to work with CM and facilitated regular visits with SM, however, bonding between mother and daughter remained minimal. In December 1989, after a second four-month wardship, the society brought a status review application seeking an order of Crown wardship without access for the purposes of adoption. CM opposed the motion and the matter was dealt with sporadically throughout 1991. In February 1992 the Ontario Provincial Court ordered that SM be returned to CM on the basis that court intervention was no longer necessary to protect the child. The judge considered CM capable of acquiring the skill to care for her daughter adequately. The society obtained a stay of the order and unsuccessfully appealed to the Ontario Court (General Division). The Court of Appeal granted a stay of the order for return pending appeal and a motion for the introduction of fresh evidence. The new evidence concerned the consistent and repeated assertions of the child that she regarded her foster family as her real family, that she did not want to see her birth mother and that attempts to implement access visits with CM had become almost impossible because of the child's negative reactions - emotional, psychological and physical.  It allowed the appeal, set aside the order for the return of the child to the mother and ordered that the child be made a Crown ward without access for the purposes of adoption. CM appealed to the Supreme Court.",Does the child need continued protection?,Appeal dismissed.,"L'Heureux-Dubé, writing for the court, reviewed the case law and determined that when a court is determining whether the wardship should be terminated or continue, the judge should not determine whether an order of wardship should have been made in the previous or earlier hearings, but instead

The review hearing is not about retrying the original need for a protection order, but rather the court should determine the circumstances of the parents or parent since the last order as it relates to the situation with respect to the child's custody, including their physical, mental and emotional state since that time and also whether there is now a lifestyle, including attitudes of the parent, that warrants the child being returned to the parent or to wardship.
She lays out a two part test:
Does the child continue to need protection and require a court order for protection?
The children's aid society must continue to justify its intervention by showing that a court order is necessary to protect the child in the future.  This does not mean that an absence of proof of a deficiency in the parent's parenting capacity is enough to return the child to the parent.  A court order may be necessary to protect the child from emotional harm which would result in future if the child were taken from its psychological parents.
What is in the best interests of the children?
This should be decided through a balancing of the considerations such as the importance of the continuity of care, the child’s physical/emotional/psychological needs, the benefit of a child's bond to his/her biological parent, as well as psychological bonding of child to his/her foster family.
The furtherance and protection of the child’s best interests must take priority over the desires and interests of the parent.
The question is not merely whether the parent has seen the light and is now prepared to be a good parent, but whether or not the parent has, in factk turned a new leaf and whether he or she is now able to give to the children the care they require?

OPENAI.gpt-4o,Miglin v Miglin,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,"The parties were married for 14 years and had four children. They operated a resort lodge in Algonquin Park in the summer and lived in Toronto in the winter. Both parties worked in the business; the husband handled the finance and the wife the day-to-day operation of the lodge. When they separated in 1993, both parties were in their early 40s and all the children were under 8 years old. The wife wanted to stay home with the children given their ages. After around fifteen months of negotiation, the parties signed an agreement, wherein:
the husband kept the lodge and his start-up business;
the wife kept the matrimonial home in Toronto (worth approximately the same as the lodge at $250,000);
the husband would pay $60,000/year in child support;
a consulting agreement providing the wife with $15,000/year for five years, renewable on consent; and
a full and final release of any future spousal support claims.
After the divorce judgment was issued in 1997, the wife's childcare obligations changed and the consulting agreement was not renewed. She applied to the court for relief, including spousal support. The trial judge referred to the husband as ""manipulative"" and ""obsessive"". The application was allowed, child support was brought in line with the
Guidelines
and the wife was awarded support of $4,400/month for five years. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment regarding spousal support, and the husband was given leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.",When should a support agreement be upheld by the courts?,Appeal allowed; original support order stands.,"Arbour and Bastarache, writing for the majority, stress finality and certainty as key principles in support agreements, citing
s. 9 of the
Divorce Act
; these are contracts and as long as they were entered into openly, the courts should enforce them.
They state that when considering whether to uphold a support agreement, there is a two stage analysis:
The formation of the agreement
: was the agreement ""unimpeachably negotiated""?
Factors to consider:
representation by counsel: the degree of professional assistance received by the party is relevant, but a court should not presume an imbalance of power.
circumstances: was one or both parties vulnerable and if so, did presence of counsel rectify this vulnerability?
duration of negotiations: was the agreement negotiated over a reasonable amount of time?
Substance of the agreement: does the agreement remain in substantial compliance with the objectives of the
Divorce Act
?
The analysis should not be restricted to the spousal support component – look at the whole agreement; the agreement as a whole should substantially comply with the factors and objectives of the
Act
(including the principles of certainty, autonomy and finality).
An agreement can be modified to bring it in line with the principles in the
Act
.
Agreement's correspondence to the parties' original intentions
: were the current circumstances anticipated when the agreement was drafted?
Foreseeability is interpreted broadly; circumstances do not have to have been explicitly considered/contemplated
Foreseeable circumstances include a change of job, assets going down in value, etc.

Generally, where negotiation of the agreement was correct and the agreement remains in substantial compliance with the
Act
, the court should defer to the wishes of the party and accord the agreement great weight.
Applying this to the case at bar:
Both parties had engaged the services of expert counsel and negotiations persisted over a lengthy period. Although the husband may have been the dominant party, the wife had adequate counsel; there was no hint of any vulnerabilities that might not be compensated by counsel.
The quantum of child support established in the agreement intended to provide the wife with a minimum amount of income in contemplation of her not working. While the wife argues that the business generates income, this was accounted for when the assets were valued and divided. The consulting contract reflects the parties' intention to provide the wife with a source of employment income for a limited time. The wife chose not to go back to the workforce, and had substantial assets even without support; there was no hardship or long-term disadvantage.
In the result, the original order should stand.
LeBel and Deschamps, in the dissent, stress very different concepts: interdependence and unequal bargaining power.  They propose a simpler test; is the agreement objectively unfair when considered now?
The dissenters disagree with the majority in two key areas.  One, the presence of counsel may not be enough to negate a power imbalance, and two, that very little deference should be given to agreements that deviate from the objectives in
s. 15.2(6)
of the
Act
; any fair agreement should reasonably realize the four stated objectives.","Establishes the test for enforcement of support agreements.

While in the 27th week of pregnancy she was driving her car when her negligent actions caused a car accident.  The fetus was permanently injured, and was born prematurely that day.  Her son, Ryan Dobson, suffered physical and mental injuries, including cerebral palsy.  His grandfather launched a tort claim for damages against his mother.  Ryan was successful at the Court of Appeal, which his mother appealed.",Should a mother be liable in tort for damages to her child arising from a prenatal negligent act that allegedly injured the fetus in her womb?,Appeal allowed.,"Cory, writing for the majority, finds that the mother should not be held liable in the situation because of the policy implications.  They employ the
Kamloops
test to determine if a duty of care should be owed.  It has two parts:
Is the relationship between the two parties close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there any public policy implications that should negate or limit the scope of the duty?
They find that the first part is satisfied; however the public policy implications negate the duty.  They state that there are two main reasons for this: it would violate the privacy and autonomy of women, and it is impossible to judicially define a reasonable standard of conduct for pregnant women.
McLachlin, in a concurring judgment, states that another main reason why this duty cannot be imposed is that it would violate pregnant women's rights under the
Charter
– specifically liberty and equality.  They would lose their liberty, and not be treated equally with other women in society.
Major, in the dissent, states that in order for the public policy implications to negate the duty they must add new restrictions on what the woman can do.  He says that this is not the case, because she had a duty of care to everyone else on the road, and extending that to the foetus would not change the reasonable standard of her conduct.  He says that this case deals specifically with pregnant women driving automobiles, and if the creation of duty imposed a limitation on her actions that was not there previously then the outcome would be different.  He uses the example with another pregnant woman in the car – if the same outcome occurred, then there is no question that the other woman's foetus could sue her for negligence.  He agrees that the
Kamloops
test applies, but says that the policy implications here do not negate the duty.","Pregnant women do not owe a duty of care to the foetus in their womb.

She was sent away from her mother, who cared for her, during the week so that she could attend a special school.  Her mother was seeking the court's permission to perform a sterilization procedure (hysterectomy) on her daughter.  There was considerable evidence that the daughter would be incapable of handling the burdens of motherhood.  Eve had struck up a friendship with a boy from school, and discussed marriage, and her mother is afraid of the burden that would be placed on Eve, and ultimately upon herself to look after a child if pregnancy ensued.  Permission was denied at trial, but granted at the Court of Appeal.",Can a caregiver for someone incapable of giving informed consent make decisions about surgeries for the incapable individual?,Appeal allowed.,"La Forest, writing for a unanimous court, discusses the history of
parens patriae
jurisdiction, which states that the state is responsible for decisions concerning those that cannot give informed consent themselves. He says that the test is generally that the only procedures that will be allowed are ones that are in the ""best interests"" of the protected person. He focuses his criticism in this case on the fact that Mrs. E. is claiming that the burden on her to look after the child should be considered in making the decision. La Forest states that this should be given no consideration, as it is only the best interests of the protected person that are of concern.
He also says that arguing about the protected person's fitness as a parents involves value-loaded questions that result in a designation of disabled persons as less competent parents, even though there is significant evidence showing that they show as much fondness and concern for their children as anyone else. He also considers that the procedure of a hysterectomy is serious surgery and quite invasive, and further that Eve does not require assistance caring for her reproductive cycle, which is a concern in other cases. Perhaps most importantly, this surgery is not therapeutic.
La Forest concludes that ""the grave intrusion on a person’s rights and the certain physical damage that ensues from non-therapeutic sterilization without consent, when compared to the highly questionable advantages that can result, [show that] it can never safely be determined that such a procedure is for the benefit of the person."" The procedure should never be authorized for non-therapeutic purposes under the

The father had sole interim custody after separation but then the parties entered into an informal shared custody arrangement where neither party paid support.  Three years later the mother brought an action in Alberta for retroactive and ongoing support.  The chambers judge awarded her prospective support but not retroactive.  The Court of Appeal allowed her appeal, but found no blameworthy conduct or willful failure to disclose on the part of the father.
Three children were born in the course of a common law relationship. After separation the children lived with the mother, and some months later the father paid $150 in child support pursuant to a maintenance agreement which was increased to $300/month following a consent order.  The mother brought an action for retroactive support.  The father had low income and high access costs and resisted the action.  The chambers judge held retroactive support would constitute hardship.
Parents married in 1984 and divorced in 1991. After separation the two children lived with their mother and a divorce judgment ordered the father to pay $700/month in child support.  In 2000 the mother signaled an intention to request increased support.  The father voluntarily increased his payments, but still below the table amount.  The mother was unaware that his income had increased dramatically as they lived in different cities.  At chambers, the judge granted her application for retroactive support based on the table amount, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal in a 2-1 judgment.
Parents divorced in 1996.  The children lived with the father, then one of the children moved to lived with the mother.  The father had a lot more income and the mother asked for an increase of support but the father rejected the request.  The mother was hesitant to take the case to court because earlier proceedings had caused a rift between the mother and children.  The chambers judge held that this was an appropriate circumstance for a retroactive award, and he calculated it from January 1, 2003 onward, to be paid in the amount of $500/month, as a ""reasonable compromise"" that best fit the situation of the parties.

To prevent liability for retroactive support, any changes in income should be reported to the custodial parent.  If this is not done and an application is brought to enforce a change, four factors should be analysed to see if retroactive support is warranted:
Undue delay: does the recipient have a reasonable excuse for not seeking support earlier?
Any voluntary, intentional choice not to apply for an increase will militate against retroactive support.  There is a balancing here; a child should not be punished for a poor choice of the parent.
Was there blameworthy conduct on the part of the payor?
This is interpreted broadly; anything that privileges the payor's interests over his/her children's right to an appropriate amount of support.
Could the payor have reasonably believed that they were discharging their support obligations?
The more significant a change in income, the more likely a court will find a payor's behaviour blameworthy if they do not proactively disclose.
Need of child/benefit: would the child benefit from retroactive award based on their needs/circumstances?
If a child's needs are being met by the current support, this will militate against a retroactive award.
Would a retroactive award cause hardship to payor?
This is a distinct element from the
s. 10
undue hardship test.
Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.

Turning to how far back retroactive payments should go, it turns on the conduct of the parents.  If there was no blameworthy behaviour, the retroactivity should go to when the custodial parent informs the payor that they are seeking additional support.  Generally there will be a limit of 3 years.  For blameworthy parents, the retroactivity should continue to when the support should have changed and did not, without limit.
As to the amount of a retroactive payment, the court should follow the
Guidelines
, but the court has broad discretion to craft a remedy that would be fair having regard to all the circumstances, including hardship on the payor.
Applying this to the cases...
This was an initial application for child support.  The parents had a shared custody arrangement that thought that meant no child support was payable (see
Contino v Leonelli-Contino
).  The incomes of the parents were relatively equal and due to the shared custody any money going to one household would simply be removed from the other.  Due to the lack of blameworthy conduct and the lack of benefit to the children, no retroactive support was awarded.
The father from whom support was being sought was low income (~$23,000/year) and he was supporting a second family.  Any retroactive award would cause his household hardship.  The access costs for him were also high.  Because of the lack of blameworthy conduct, the hardship a retroactive award would cause, and the fact that the standard of living in the custodial household was higher, no retroactive support was awarded.
In this case, the mother had broached the subject with the father but could not afford a lawyer to fight the case.  She was intimidated by her ex-husband and did not know much about his financial situation as he lived in another city.  The husband had had a huge income increase and held it from her, as well as saying that she should have managed her money better to better provide for their kids and that he was paying all he could afford.  Due to the large amount of blameworthy conduct and the large discrepancy in the amount he was paying and the table amount, the court awarded $100,000 in retroactive support.
As in
Henry
, the parties had very different incomes; the father earned more than $100,000K/year, much more than the mother, and he gave no financial support when the need arose.  The mother said she had not wanted to litigate because of the effect it had had on her daughter the last time they litigated.  The court held that the delay of mother was not unreasonable, and the father had no reasonable grounds on which to believe the level of support he was paying was reasonable, and thus the award granted at trial was upheld.
Abella, dissenting in part, had three issues with the decision of Bastarache.
The presumptive starting date of effective notice: the payor has the information on when their income changes, so it is impractical and unrealistic to expect the recipient to keep tabs on the payor’s income; the date should be when the income changes.
The role of blameworthy conduct: the conduct of the payor should be immaterial; the whole obligation depends on the income increase, conduct of the parties is irrelevant.
The three year cutoff: Abella finds this arbitrary - any cutoff of this type should be found in statute, not created by the courts.","Retroactive child support orders should no longer be rare or difficult to obtain.
Established the framework for assessing claims where there is a large, undisclosed swing in income.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?
Children are entitled to support from both parents commensurate with their ability to pay.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?
This case is sometimes referred to as the ""don't-ask-don't-tell"" case, as the

He reaffirmed the principle that there exists a ""general area"" or ""domain"" of criminal law and the two governments can make law on the same matter by creating a distinction between the types of culpability.  He quotes from Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law:
There are only two states of mind which constitute
mens rea
, and they are intention and recklessness. The difference between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; they are opposed and it is a logical fallacy to suggest that recklessness is a degree of negligence. The common habit of lawyers to qualify the word ""negligence"" with some moral epithet such as ""wicked"", ""gross"", or ""culpable"" has been most unfortunate since it has inevitably led to great confusion of thought and of principle. It is equally misleading to speak of criminal negligence since this is merely to use an expression to explain itself.
On the facts, Judson found that there was overlap between the laws however ""there is no conflict between these provisions in the sense that they are repugnant"". The provincial law extended to include ""inadvertent negligence"" as well as regular negligence. It was enough that “the two pieces of legislation differed both in legislative purpose and legal and practical effect” to justify both of them.","The distinction between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; recklessness is when an actor does not desire harmful consequences but forsees the possibility and consciously takes the risk.

Mr. Grismer filed a complaint with the British Columbia Council of Human Rights.,"Does the Superintendent's blanket refusal to issue a licence to anyone with this condition, without individual assessment, constitute discrimination contrary to the British Columbia Human Rights Act?",The Court held that the Superintendent's policy was discriminatory. The case was sent back to the Superintendent to assess Mr. Grismer's ability to drive safely on an individual basis.,"The Court found that the Superintendent should not have relied on a blanket exclusionary policy, but rather should have assessed each case individually to see if the person could drive safely. Failure to do so constituted discrimination based on a disability.","Individualized assessment is required when a government policy or action treats a group of people differently based on a protected characteristic like disability. Blanket exclusionary policies, without individual assessment, can be discriminatory.","The Government of British Columbia had a policy stating that it would not issue licenses to people suffering from a condition (homonymous hemianopsia (HH)) which affected eyesight.  The claimant had this condition but had driven flawlessly at work and on public roads using ""prism glasses"".  Despite this he was refused individual assessment and was not allowed to receive a license and was therefore unable to complete his job.  The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal allowed Grismer to be individually tested.  Grismer died shortly after this decision.  This was upheld by the British Columbia Supreme Court but overruled by the Court of Appeal.",Does an absolute prohibition on licensing people with a visual impairment without the possibility of individual assessment constitute discrimination?,"Appeal allowed, standard disallowed.","The court applies the
Meiorin
test, showing that it can be used in scenarios outside of the workplace to determine if discrimination is justified.  This case passes the first part because the purpose of the standard (reasonable safety) is rationally connected to the function (issuing drivers’ licenses).  It also passes the second step because there is no evidence that the standard (no licenses for HH sufferers) was adopted for any reasons other than road safety.  However the case fails the third step as the court finds that the standard (no licenses for HH) is not reasonably necessary for the purpose (reasonable safety).  The blanket prohibition doesn't let people even attempt to show that they can drive safely.
It is clear here that the accommodation would be to allow testing.  In order to succeed the government would have had to prove that to allow testing would result to undue hardship which they failed to do.  Although there are clearly safety and cost concerns involved with testing, the government didn't put in any effort to determine these values, nor did they even look for alternative ways of testing.  The court also says that in general, with the government, costs must be exorbitant to amount to undue hardship, as they are publicly funded and this would be seen as being in the public interest.  As the standard is not rationally necessary for the purpose of reasonable road safety, it amounts to discrimination and must be removed.","The
Meiorin
test applies to all standards that are thought to be discriminatory, even if they do not occur in a workplace; called bona fide justification tests.
The government will be held to a very high threshold when claiming that the costs of not adopting a standard amount to undue hardship as they are publicly funded and preventing discrimination is in the public interest."
ANTHROPIC.claude-3-opus-latest,Just v British Columbia,,,,,,"Heavy snow fall forced Just and his daughter to stop in a line of traffic by a rocky slope on a major highway.  A boulder, which worked loose from the wooded slopes above the highway, came crashing down on the appellant's car, killing the appellant's daughter and causing him very serious injuries.  Just brought an action against the provincial government contending that the government negligently failed to properly maintain the highway.
The Department of Highways had set up a system for inspection and remedial work upon rock slopes.  Inspection and recommendations were made by engineers and the work was effected by a rock scaling crew responsible for performing remedial work throughout the entire province.  The department's practice had been to make visual inspections from the highway unless rock falls or a history of instability in an area indicated a need for the rock engineer to climb the slope.  Numerous informal inspections were carried out by highway personnel as they drove along the road.
The trial judge found that the entire system of inspection and the way it was implemented was a policy matter which did not give rise to liability. No finding was made as to whether or not the system of inspection was reasonable or whether the inspections themselves were properly carried out. The Court of Appeal upheld the finding of the trial judge and Just appealled to the Supreme Court.","Is the government under a duty of care to maintain the highways and if so, are they liable if the highways are not sufficiently maintained?","Appeal allowed, new trial ordered.","Cory, writing for the majority, held that the province owes a duty of care, which ordinarily extends to their reasonable maintenance, to those using its highways.  The Department of Highways could readily foresee the risk that harm might befall users of a highway if it were not reasonably maintained.  That maintenance could be found to extend to the prevention of injury from falling rock.
Government agencies may be exempt from the application of the traditional tort law duty of care if an explicit statutory exemption exists or if the decision arose as a result of a policy decision.  Whether or not a decision is characterized as a policy decision or as an operational decision rests on the nature of the decision and not on the identity of the actors.  Generally, decisions concerning budgetary allotments for departments or government agencies should be classified as policy decisions.  A policy decision may be open to challenge on the basis that it is not made in the bona fide exercise of discretion.  If after due consideration it is found that a duty of care is owed by the government agency and no exemption by way of statute or policy decision-making is found to exist, a traditional torts analysis ensues (as per
Anns v Merton London Borough Council
) and the issue of standard of care required of the government agency must next be considered.  The manner and quality of an inspection system, since it was clearly part of the operational aspect of a governmental activity, should be assessed when consideration is given to the standard of care issue.  At this stage, the requisite standard of care must be assessed in light of all the surrounding circumstances including budgetary restraints and the availability of qualified personnel and equipment.
Sopinka, in the dissent, held that the government had the power to carry out the inspections but was under no duty to do so.  Conduct within the limits of this discretion gives rise to no duty of care; conduct outside of these limits may attract a private law duty of care.
A litigant may not attack a policy and it is not appropriate for a Court to pass on it, absent evidence that a policy was adopted for some ulterior motive and not for a municipal purpose.  In order for a private duty to arise, it would have to be shown that the Rockwork Section acted outside its delegated discretion to determine whether to inspect and the manner in which the inspection is to be made.  Policy decisions are immune from review because they usually entail not only a decision to do something but also some call upon the public purse.  The government was acting within its discretion when it decided that inspections should be done and the manner in which they were to be done.  Responsibility for deciding the extent to which the inspection program was to be implemented was delegated to the Rockwork Section.","The duty of care should apply to a public authority unless there is a valid basis for its exclusion.
Policy decisions – the decision by the government about what acts to perform under a given statute – are exempt from liability; operational decisions – the decision by the government about how to perform those acts once they have been decided - are not exempt from liability."

The Court also held that the operators did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the duration of their calls while at work.,"An employer may monitor the duration of employees' calls if it is a reasonable measure to ensure operational efficiency and does not violate the employees' reasonable expectation of privacy in the workplace, provided that such monitoring is not prohibited by the collective agreement.","This is an appeal of the decision in

.  On appeal Bell is arguing that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal process is unfair because the Canadian Human Rights Commission makes regulations that the Tribunal must follow, and then appears in front of them seeking favorable decisions.  They claim that this constitutes a conflict of interest and a lack of necessary ""judicial"" independence.",Does the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal lack independence and impartiality because of the power of the Canadian Human Rights Commission to issue binding guidelines for them before they appear in front of them?,"Appeal dismissed, case to proceed to Tribunal.","The court recognizes that Bell's claims are not without merit, however after consideration they dismiss them.  The court held that Bell did not provide sufficient evidence for their claims and also because they misunderstand impartiality - it does not mean having the freedom to decide a case however one wishes to, being subject to certain binding principles is perfectly legitimate for an impartial judiciary.  Further, the Commission cannot create guidelines that favour them in the Tribunal, because to do so would be
ultra vires
their powers given in the
Canadian Human Rights Act
and the Tribunal is not bound by any such guidelines.  The powers that the Commission has to enact guidelines under
s.27(2)
and
s.27(3)
of the
Act
are constrained as all powers to create subordinate legislation are, and therefore the system is not flawed.","Having one's decisions bound by enacted guidelines does not affect impartiality.

ANTHROPIC.claude-3-opus-latest,Catholic Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto v CM,The appellant C.M. was 16 years old and 5 months pregnant. She refused to consent to medical treatment that would prolong her life. The Catholic Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto sought a court order to force the treatment against C.M.'s wishes.,Does an individual under the age of 16 have the right to refuse medical treatment or must their decision be overridden based on their best interests as determined by the court?,The appeal was dismissed. C.M. was found to have the right to refuse medical treatment.,"Section 7 of the Charter protects the right of competent individuals to make decisions concerning their own bodies. While courts maintain parens patriae jurisdiction over minors, this is only to be exercised where necessary to protect them from harm. In this case, C.M. was found to be sufficiently mature to make her own treatment decision and her right to do so was upheld.",A minor who is capable of making their own treatment decisions has the constitutional right to bodily integrity and personal autonomy in doing so. The court should not exercise its parens patriae jurisdiction to override a mature minor's treatment refusal unless it is necessary to prevent serious harm.,"The aid society took SM into protection on several occasions and supervised her mother, CM, on parenting skills. On consent, SM was made a ward of the society 1989. Throughout the wardship, the society continued to work with CM and facilitated regular visits with SM, however, bonding between mother and daughter remained minimal. In December 1989, after a second four-month wardship, the society brought a status review application seeking an order of Crown wardship without access for the purposes of adoption. CM opposed the motion and the matter was dealt with sporadically throughout 1991. In February 1992 the Ontario Provincial Court ordered that SM be returned to CM on the basis that court intervention was no longer necessary to protect the child. The judge considered CM capable of acquiring the skill to care for her daughter adequately. The society obtained a stay of the order and unsuccessfully appealed to the Ontario Court (General Division). The Court of Appeal granted a stay of the order for return pending appeal and a motion for the introduction of fresh evidence. The new evidence concerned the consistent and repeated assertions of the child that she regarded her foster family as her real family, that she did not want to see her birth mother and that attempts to implement access visits with CM had become almost impossible because of the child's negative reactions - emotional, psychological and physical.  It allowed the appeal, set aside the order for the return of the child to the mother and ordered that the child be made a Crown ward without access for the purposes of adoption. CM appealed to the Supreme Court.",Does the child need continued protection?,Appeal dismissed.,"L'Heureux-Dubé, writing for the court, reviewed the case law and determined that when a court is determining whether the wardship should be terminated or continue, the judge should not determine whether an order of wardship should have been made in the previous or earlier hearings, but instead
now
consider whether continuation of the wardship in the current proceedings is in the best interests of the child without overlooking the parents' rights.  The review hearing is not about retrying the original need for a protection order, but rather the court should determine the circumstances of the parents or parent since the last order as it relates to the situation with respect to the child's custody, including their physical, mental and emotional state since that time and also whether there is now a lifestyle, including attitudes of the parent, that warrants the child being returned to the parent or to wardship.
She lays out a two part test:
Does the child continue to need protection and require a court order for protection?
The children's aid society must continue to justify its intervention by showing that a court order is necessary to protect the child in the future.  This does not mean that an absence of proof of a deficiency in the parent's parenting capacity is enough to return the child to the parent.  A court order may be necessary to protect the child from emotional harm which would result in future if the child were taken from its psychological parents.
What is in the best interests of the children?
This should be decided through a balancing of the considerations such as the importance of the continuity of care, the child’s physical/emotional/psychological needs, the benefit of a child's bond to his/her biological parent, as well as psychological bonding of child to his/her foster family.
The furtherance and protection of the child’s best interests must take priority over the desires and interests of the parent.
The question is not merely whether the parent has seen the light and is now prepared to be a good parent, but whether or not the parent has, in factk turned a new leaf and whether he or she is now able to give to the children the care they require?

ANTHROPIC.claude-3-opus-latest,Miglin v Miglin,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,"The parties were married for 14 years and had four children. They operated a resort lodge in Algonquin Park in the summer and lived in Toronto in the winter. Both parties worked in the business; the husband handled the finance and the wife the day-to-day operation of the lodge. When they separated in 1993, both parties were in their early 40s and all the children were under 8 years old. The wife wanted to stay home with the children given their ages. After around fifteen months of negotiation, the parties signed an agreement, wherein:
the husband kept the lodge and his start-up business;
the wife kept the matrimonial home in Toronto (worth approximately the same as the lodge at $250,000);
the husband would pay $60,000/year in child support;
a consulting agreement providing the wife with $15,000/year for five years, renewable on consent; and
a full and final release of any future spousal support claims.
After the divorce judgment was issued in 1997, the wife's childcare obligations changed and the consulting agreement was not renewed. She applied to the court for relief, including spousal support. The trial judge referred to the husband as ""manipulative"" and ""obsessive"". The application was allowed, child support was brought in line with the
Guidelines
and the wife was awarded support of $4,400/month for five years. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment regarding spousal support, and the husband was given leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.",When should a support agreement be upheld by the courts?,Appeal allowed; original support order stands.,"Arbour and Bastarache, writing for the majority, stress finality and certainty as key principles in support agreements, citing
s. 9 of the
Divorce Act
; these are contracts and as long as they were entered into openly, the courts should enforce them.
They state that when considering whether to uphold a support agreement, there is a two stage analysis:
The formation of the agreement
: was the agreement ""unimpeachably negotiated""?
Factors to consider:
representation by counsel: the degree of professional assistance received by the party is relevant, but a court should not presume an imbalance of power.
circumstances: was one or both parties vulnerable and if so, did presence of counsel rectify this vulnerability?
duration of negotiations: was the agreement negotiated over a reasonable amount of time?
Substance of the agreement: does the agreement remain in substantial compliance with the objectives of the
Divorce Act
?
The analysis should not be restricted to the spousal support component – look at the whole agreement; the agreement as a whole should substantially comply with the factors and objectives of the
Act
(including the principles of certainty, autonomy and finality).
An agreement can be modified to bring it in line with the principles in the
Act
.
Agreement's correspondence to the parties' original intentions
: were the current circumstances anticipated when the agreement was drafted?
Foreseeability is interpreted broadly; circumstances do not have to have been explicitly considered/contemplated
Foreseeable circumstances include a change of job, assets going down in value, etc.

Generally, where negotiation of the agreement was correct and the agreement remains in substantial compliance with the
Act
, the court should defer to the wishes of the party and accord the agreement great weight.
Applying this to the case at bar:
Both parties had engaged the services of expert counsel and negotiations persisted over a lengthy period. Although the husband may have been the dominant party, the wife had adequate counsel; there was no hint of any vulnerabilities that might not be compensated by counsel.
The quantum of child support established in the agreement intended to provide the wife with a minimum amount of income in contemplation of her not working. While the wife argues that the business generates income, this was accounted for when the assets were valued and divided. The consulting contract reflects the parties' intention to provide the wife with a source of employment income for a limited time. The wife chose not to go back to the workforce, and had substantial assets even without support; there was no hardship or long-term disadvantage.
In the result, the original order should stand.
LeBel and Deschamps, in the dissent, stress very different concepts: interdependence and unequal bargaining power.  They propose a simpler test; is the agreement objectively unfair when considered now?
The dissenters disagree with the majority in two key areas.  One, the presence of counsel may not be enough to negate a power imbalance, and two, that very little deference should be given to agreements that deviate from the objectives in
s. 15.2(6)
of the
Act
; any fair agreement should reasonably realize the four stated objectives.","Establishes the test for enforcement of support agreements.

While in the 27th week of pregnancy she was driving her car when her negligent actions caused a car accident.  The fetus was permanently injured, and was born prematurely that day.  Her son, Ryan Dobson, suffered physical and mental injuries, including cerebral palsy.  His grandfather launched a tort claim for damages against his mother.  Ryan was successful at the Court of Appeal, which his mother appealed.",Should a mother be liable in tort for damages to her child arising from a prenatal negligent act that allegedly injured the fetus in her womb?,Appeal allowed.,"Cory, writing for the majority, finds that the mother should not be held liable in the situation because of the policy implications.  They employ the
Kamloops
test to determine if a duty of care should be owed.  It has two parts:
Is the relationship between the two parties close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there any public policy implications that should negate or limit the scope of the duty?
They find that the first part is satisfied; however the public policy implications negate the duty.  They state that there are two main reasons for this: it would violate the privacy and autonomy of women, and it is impossible to judicially define a reasonable standard of conduct for pregnant women.
McLachlin, in a concurring judgment, states that another main reason why this duty cannot be imposed is that it would violate pregnant women's rights under the
Charter
– specifically liberty and equality.  They would lose their liberty, and not be treated equally with other women in society.
Major, in the dissent, states that in order for the public policy implications to negate the duty they must add new restrictions on what the woman can do.  He says that this is not the case, because she had a duty of care to everyone else on the road, and extending that to the foetus would not change the reasonable standard of her conduct.  He says that this case deals specifically with pregnant women driving automobiles, and if the creation of duty imposed a limitation on her actions that was not there previously then the outcome would be different.  He uses the example with another pregnant woman in the car – if the same outcome occurred, then there is no question that the other woman's foetus could sue her for negligence.  He agrees that the
Kamloops
test applies, but says that the policy implications here do not negate the duty.","Pregnant women do not owe a duty of care to the foetus in their womb.

MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,Calder et al. v British Columbia (Attorney General),"Calder and others claimed aboriginal title to a large area of land in British Columbia.  They argued that their ancestors had occupied and used the land continuously since before the arrival of Europeans. The Province of British Columbia argued that the claim was invalid, citing various statutes and historical precedent.

The matter involved extensive historical evidence, including oral histories, land use patterns, and archaeological evidence.",Did the claimants have aboriginal title to the disputed lands in British Columbia?,"The Supreme Court of Canada found in favour of the claimants, recognizing the existence of aboriginal title.","The court considered the historical context of the aboriginal relationship to the land, noting the continuity of occupation and use by the claimants' ancestors. The court emphasized the importance of oral histories and other traditional evidence, alongside archaeological and documentary evidence.  They rejected the Province's arguments based on specific statutes and historical interpretations, finding them insufficient to dismiss the claims.","Aboriginal title, when established, is a distinct form of land tenure that predates Crown sovereignty.  It requires a comprehensive analysis of the historical relationship between the Aboriginal people and the land, including the continuity of occupation and use, and the nature of that relationship.  Oral histories, traditional knowledge, and other forms of evidence can be used to establish aboriginal title.","The appellants are representative of the Nishga Tribe of British Columbia.  They claim that the aboriginal title over a piece of land in British Columbia that had been present before Confederation had never been extinguished, and that the tribe therefore still had title to the land.  This claim was denied at trial and upheld at appeal.","Do the alleged aboriginal land claims exist?
If the claims exist, were they extinguished?",Appeal dismissed.,"At trial and upon initial appeal the courts decided that if there ever was aboriginal title, it was surely extinguished upon confederation.  The Supreme Court holds that aboriginal title definitely exists, however they were split over whether or not it had been extinguished.  The majority decided that it has been extinguished by virtue of the government's exercise of control over the lands, and therefore the appeal is dismissed.  However, the dissenting judges disagree and state that more must be present to prove that the lands were extinguished.  They say that the provincial government did not have any constitutional right to deal with the land of the aboriginals, and that their predecessors before confederation did not do anything that could amount to extinguishing the lands.","Recognition of aboriginal title.

She was sent away from her mother, who cared for her, during the week so that she could attend a special school.  Her mother was seeking the court's permission to perform a sterilization procedure (hysterectomy) on her daughter.  There was considerable evidence that the daughter would be incapable of handling the burdens of motherhood.  Eve had struck up a friendship with a boy from school, and discussed marriage, and her mother is afraid of the burden that would be placed on Eve, and ultimately upon herself to look after a child if pregnancy ensued.  Permission was denied at trial, but granted at the Court of Appeal.",Can a caregiver for someone incapable of giving informed consent make decisions about surgeries for the incapable individual?,Appeal allowed.,"La Forest, writing for a unanimous court, discusses the history of
parens patriae
jurisdiction, which states that the state is responsible for decisions concerning those that cannot give informed consent themselves. He says that the test is generally that the only procedures that will be allowed are ones that are in the ""best interests"" of the protected person. He focuses his criticism in this case on the fact that Mrs. E. is claiming that the burden on her to look after the child should be considered in making the decision. La Forest states that this should be given no consideration, as it is only the best interests of the protected person that are of concern.
He also says that arguing about the protected person's fitness as a parents involves value-loaded questions that result in a designation of disabled persons as less competent parents, even though there is significant evidence showing that they show as much fondness and concern for their children as anyone else. He also considers that the procedure of a hysterectomy is serious surgery and quite invasive, and further that Eve does not require assistance caring for her reproductive cycle, which is a concern in other cases. Perhaps most importantly, this surgery is not therapeutic.
La Forest concludes that ""the grave intrusion on a person’s rights and the certain physical damage that ensues from non-therapeutic sterilization without consent, when compared to the highly questionable advantages that can result, [show that] it can never safely be determined that such a procedure is for the benefit of the person."" The procedure should never be authorized for non-therapeutic purposes under the
parens patriae
jurisdiction.","Non-therapeutic surgeries can never be determined to be for the benefit of a person who is incapable of giving informed consent.

The requirements included a minimum physical ability test (PAT) that women, due to their inherent biological differences, were statistically less likely to pass.  The position involved significant physical exertion and required firefighters to lift heavy equipment, operate machinery, and carry hose lines.","Did the physical ability test, which disproportionately excluded women from fire-fighting positions in British Columbia, constitute discriminatory treatment based on sex, contrary to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms?","Yes, the physical ability test was discriminatory. ","The Court recognized that gender-based differences in physical capacity exist, but found that the physical ability test, as structured, was not demonstrably related to job performance or safety.  The test disproportionately excluded women without evidence that this exclusion was justified by a demonstrably different ability to perform the essential job functions.  The employer did not adequately explore other ways to ensure the required physical capacity.  A gender-neutral approach that considered the individual capabilities of each applicant would have been justified.  The employer did not consider less strenuous options for assessing candidates.","Discriminatory treatment based on sex, under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, arises when a requirement or practice, although seemingly neutral on its face, disproportionately affects members of one sex and is not demonstrably related to job performance or safety.

The father had sole interim custody after separation but then the parties entered into an informal shared custody arrangement where neither party paid support.  Three years later the mother brought an action in Alberta for retroactive and ongoing support.  The chambers judge awarded her prospective support but not retroactive.  The Court of Appeal allowed her appeal, but found no blameworthy conduct or willful failure to disclose on the part of the father.
Three children were born in the course of a common law relationship. After separation the children lived with the mother, and some months later the father paid $150 in child support pursuant to a maintenance agreement which was increased to $300/month following a consent order.  The mother brought an action for retroactive support.  The father had low income and high access costs and resisted the action.  The chambers judge held retroactive support would constitute hardship.
Parents married in 1984 and divorced in 1991. After separation the two children lived with their mother and a divorce judgment ordered the father to pay $700/month in child support.  In 2000 the mother signaled an intention to request increased support.  The father voluntarily increased his payments, but still below the table amount.  The mother was unaware that his income had increased dramatically as they lived in different cities.  At chambers, the judge granted her application for retroactive support based on the table amount, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal in a 2-1 judgment.
Parents divorced in 1996.  The children lived with the father, then one of the children moved to lived with the mother.  The father had a lot more income and the mother asked for an increase of support but the father rejected the request.  The mother was hesitant to take the case to court because earlier proceedings had caused a rift between the mother and children.  The chambers judge held that this was an appropriate circumstance for a retroactive award, and he calculated it from January 1, 2003 onward, to be paid in the amount of $500/month, as a ""reasonable compromise"" that best fit the situation of the parties.  The Court of Appeal upheld the decision.
All of these proceedings were merged before the Supreme Court.",Who is entitled to retroactive child support?,"The appeals in
DBS
and
TAR
should be allowed and the decisions of the chambers judges restored.  The appeals in
Henry
and
Hiemstra
should be dismissed.","Justice Bastarache, writing for the majority, held that children are entitled to child support from both parents commensurate with their income.  To prevent liability for retroactive support, any changes in income should be reported to the custodial parent.  If this is not done and an application is brought to enforce a change, four factors should be analysed to see if retroactive support is warranted:
Undue delay: does the recipient have a reasonable excuse for not seeking support earlier?
Any voluntary, intentional choice not to apply for an increase will militate against retroactive support.  There is a balancing here; a child should not be punished for a poor choice of the parent.
Was there blameworthy conduct on the part of the payor?
This is interpreted broadly; anything that privileges the payor's interests over his/her children's right to an appropriate amount of support.
Could the payor have reasonably believed that they were discharging their support obligations?
The more significant a change in income, the more likely a court will find a payor's behaviour blameworthy if they do not proactively disclose.
Need of child/benefit: would the child benefit from retroactive award based on their needs/circumstances?
If a child's needs are being met by the current support, this will militate against a retroactive award.
Would a retroactive award cause hardship to payor?
This is a distinct element from the
s. 10
undue hardship test.
Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.

Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.
Turning to how far back retroactive payments should go, it turns on the conduct of the parents.  If there was no blameworthy behaviour, the retroactivity should go to when the custodial parent informs the payor that they are seeking additional support.  Generally there will be a limit of 3 years.  For blameworthy parents, the retroactivity should continue to when the support should have changed and did not, without limit.
As to the amount of a retroactive payment, the court should follow the
Guidelines
, but the court has broad discretion to craft a remedy that would be fair having regard to all the circumstances, including hardship on the payor.
Applying this to the cases...
This was an initial application for child support.  The parents had a shared custody arrangement that thought that meant no child support was payable (see
Contino v Leonelli-Contino
).  The incomes of the parents were relatively equal and due to the shared custody any money going to one household would simply be removed from the other.  Due to the lack of blameworthy conduct and the lack of benefit to the children, no retroactive support was awarded.
The father from whom support was being sought was low income (~$23,000/year) and he was supporting a second family.  Any retroactive award would cause his household hardship.  The access costs for him were also high.  Because of the lack of blameworthy conduct, the hardship a retroactive award would cause, and the fact that the standard of living in the custodial household was higher, no retroactive support was awarded.
In this case, the mother had broached the subject with the father but could not afford a lawyer to fight the case.  She was intimidated by her ex-husband and did not know much about his financial situation as he lived in another city.  The husband had had a huge income increase and held it from her, as well as saying that she should have managed her money better to better provide for their kids and that he was paying all he could afford.  Due to the large amount of blameworthy conduct and the large discrepancy in the amount he was paying and the table amount, the court awarded $100,000 in retroactive support.
As in
Henry
, the parties had very different incomes; the father earned more than $100,000K/year, much more than the mother, and he gave no financial support when the need arose.  The mother said she had not wanted to litigate because of the effect it had had on her daughter the last time they litigated.  The court held that the delay of mother was not unreasonable, and the father had no reasonable grounds on which to believe the level of support he was paying was reasonable, and thus the award granted at trial was upheld.
Abella, dissenting in part, had three issues with the decision of Bastarache.
The presumptive starting date of effective notice: the payor has the information on when their income changes, so it is impractical and unrealistic to expect the recipient to keep tabs on the payor’s income; the date should be when the income changes.
The role of blameworthy conduct: the conduct of the payor should be immaterial; the whole obligation depends on the income increase, conduct of the parties is irrelevant.
The three year cutoff: Abella finds this arbitrary - any cutoff of this type should be found in statute, not created by the courts.","Retroactive child support orders should no longer be rare or difficult to obtain.
Established the framework for assessing claims where there is a large, undisclosed swing in income.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?
Children are entitled to support from both parents commensurate with their ability to pay.

This case is sometimes referred to as the ""don't-ask-don't-tell"" case, as the

Highway Traffic Act
(now
s. 188
) which prohibited driving ""on a highway without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway"". The defendant challenged the law, claiming that it was beyond the power of the province because the federal government had ""occupied the field"" with a similar criminal provision in ss. 191/221 (now
s. 219
) of the
Criminal Code
, which prohibited driving with ""wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons"".  O'Grady was convicted at trial and an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba was dismissed.","Are provincial laws relating to negligence with penal consequences criminal law and therefore
ultra vires
the province?",Appeal dismissed.,"Judson, writing for the majority, held that ""the power of a provincial legislature to enact legislation for the regulation of highway traffic is undoubted"".  He reaffirmed the principle that there exists a ""general area"" or ""domain"" of criminal law and the two governments can make law on the same matter by creating a distinction between the types of culpability.  He quotes from Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law:
There are only two states of mind which constitute
mens rea
, and they are intention and recklessness. The difference between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; they are opposed and it is a logical fallacy to suggest that recklessness is a degree of negligence. The common habit of lawyers to qualify the word ""negligence"" with some moral epithet such as ""wicked"", ""gross"", or ""culpable"" has been most unfortunate since it has inevitably led to great confusion of thought and of principle. It is equally misleading to speak of criminal negligence since this is merely to use an expression to explain itself.
On the facts, Judson found that there was overlap between the laws however ""there is no conflict between these provisions in the sense that they are repugnant"". The provincial law extended to include ""inadvertent negligence"" as well as regular negligence. It was enough that “the two pieces of legislation differed both in legislative purpose and legal and practical effect” to justify both of them.","The distinction between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; recklessness is when an actor does not desire harmful consequences but forsees the possibility and consciously takes the risk.
There must be an operational incompatibility between federal and provincial law to invoke paramountcy."
MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,Canada (Attorney General) v Mossup,"The case involved a challenge to a provision of the Canada's Criminal Code related to the possession of a prohibited firearm.  The accused, Mossup, had been charged with possessing a prohibited firearm.  The case focused on the specific wording of the offence, and whether the accused's actions fit the elements of the crime.","Whether the specific wording of the firearms provision in the Criminal Code, as applied to the accused, constituted a violation of his rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.","The Court found that the provision, as applied, did not violate the accused's rights under the Charter.","The Court analyzed the specific wording of the Criminal Code provision, comparing it to the accused's actions.  The Court considered the historical context of the firearm law, and the aim of the legislation, and whether the provision was clearly written and defined to ensure compliance.","The Court established that a penal statute must be sufficiently clear and precise, so as to warn a person as to which actions are prohibited. The provision in question met the requirement of clarity, preventing arbitrary or discriminatory application.  The Court emphasized the importance of following the legislative intent and applying the language of the law according to the intent and context of the provision.","Mossop is a gay man, and his partner's father died.  He applied to take bereavement leave from his job to go to the funeral, but is denied because his partner is neither a ""spouse"" nor a ""common law partner"" as they are both required to be of the opposite sex.  He makes a claim to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, but refuses to argue sexual orientation as a ground, and instead will only argue family status, stating that all matters to do with homosexuals are not about sexual orientation by definition.  The case was dismissed in the lower courts.","Can a homosexual man claim discrimination against ""family status"" with his partner under
s.3 of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
?",Appeal dismissed..,"The court is upset with the appellant who refused to deal with the claim on the ground of sexual orientation, which was new at the time.  However, Mossop sticks with family status.  The majority says that you cannot interpret ""family status"" to include Mossop’s situation unless you also discuss the ground of sexual orientation, and as Mossop refuses to do so he cannot be successful.
La Forest
concurs, but instead looks to the definitions in the Act and tries to figure out what the government meant to protect under ""family status"".  He determines that this specific field was not intended to be covered.
In the dissent,
L'Heureux-Dubé
says that ""family status"" should have a very broad interpretation.  She looks to the broader social context of limiting it as the majority does, and further that by looking at the plain meaning given in the statute you are really just taking the majority's opinion of the definition, which is exactly what you try to avoid in human rights issues.  She also suggests that when there are overlapping grounds, you should select the one that will succeed and proceed with that one.","Only identified grounds can be pursued in a human rights claim.
Definitions in human rights legislation are generally interpreted broadly, but the definition given by Parliament in the statute has a good deal of authority in the court's decision on what falls under the definition and what does not."
MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v British Columbia (Council of Human Rights) (Re Grismer Estate),The estate of a deceased driver (Grismer) sought a declaration from the British Columbia Council of Human Rights that the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles' refusal to issue a replacement driver's license to the estate was discriminatory. The estate alleged that the refusal to issue a license violated the deceased's human rights. The deceased had a learning disability.  The Superintendent argued that issuing a license to the estate would lead to confusion and safety concerns.,"Whether the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles' refusal to issue a replacement driver's license to the estate of a deceased driver, due to concerns about the deceased having a learning disability, was discriminatory and in violation of the deceased's human rights under the British Columbia Human Rights Code.",The Court held that the refusal was discriminatory.,"The Court found that the Superintendent's refusal was based on an unfounded assumption of risk, and that there was no evidence to support the claim that issuing a replacement license would pose a significant safety risk.  Furthermore, the Court emphasized that the deceased's learning disability was not a legitimate reason for denying the license to the estate.  The Court considered the possibility of accommodations for the deceased's specific disability.","A refusal to grant a driver's license based on a disability, without demonstrable evidence of a safety risk, constitutes discriminatory conduct in violation of human rights laws.  The onus is on the decision-maker to establish legitimate reasons for such a decision.","The Government of British Columbia had a policy stating that it would not issue licenses to people suffering from a condition (homonymous hemianopsia (HH)) which affected eyesight.  The claimant had this condition but had driven flawlessly at work and on public roads using ""prism glasses"".  Despite this he was refused individual assessment and was not allowed to receive a license and was therefore unable to complete his job.  The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal allowed Grismer to be individually tested.  Grismer died shortly after this decision.  This was upheld by the British Columbia Supreme Court but overruled by the Court of Appeal.",Does an absolute prohibition on licensing people with a visual impairment without the possibility of individual assessment constitute discrimination?,"Appeal allowed, standard disallowed.","The court applies the
Meiorin
test, showing that it can be used in scenarios outside of the workplace to determine if discrimination is justified.  This case passes the first part because the purpose of the standard (reasonable safety) is rationally connected to the function (issuing drivers’ licenses).  It also passes the second step because there is no evidence that the standard (no licenses for HH sufferers) was adopted for any reasons other than road safety.  However the case fails the third step as the court finds that the standard (no licenses for HH) is not reasonably necessary for the purpose (reasonable safety).  The blanket prohibition doesn't let people even attempt to show that they can drive safely.
It is clear here that the accommodation would be to allow testing.  In order to succeed the government would have had to prove that to allow testing would result to undue hardship which they failed to do.  Although there are clearly safety and cost concerns involved with testing, the government didn't put in any effort to determine these values, nor did they even look for alternative ways of testing.  The court also says that in general, with the government, costs must be exorbitant to amount to undue hardship, as they are publicly funded and this would be seen as being in the public interest.  As the standard is not rationally necessary for the purpose of reasonable road safety, it amounts to discrimination and must be removed.","The
Meiorin
test applies to all standards that are thought to be discriminatory, even if they do not occur in a workplace; called bona fide justification tests.
The government will be held to a very high threshold when claiming that the costs of not adopting a standard amount to undue hardship as they are publicly funded and preventing discrimination is in the public interest."
MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,Just v British Columbia,"A British Columbia statute prohibited the sale of certain products in specified zones during specific hours. A business owner was charged with violating this statute, arguing it was discriminatory and violated their rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.",Did the British Columbia statute violate the business owner's Charter rights?,The court found the statute to be in violation of the Charter.,"The court reasoned that the statute, though seemingly neutral on its face, had a disproportionate impact on the business owner and was not demonstrably justified by a pressing and substantial objective.  It did not provide sufficient evidence that the restriction was essential or proportionate to the objective.",Provincial legislation that restricts trade and commerce must be demonstrably justified as proportionate to a pressing and substantial objective in order to be constitutional under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  Simply being 'neutral on its face' is insufficient. The legislation must be essential to achieving the declared objective.,"Heavy snow fall forced Just and his daughter to stop in a line of traffic by a rocky slope on a major highway.  A boulder, which worked loose from the wooded slopes above the highway, came crashing down on the appellant's car, killing the appellant's daughter and causing him very serious injuries.  Just brought an action against the provincial government contending that the government negligently failed to properly maintain the highway.
The Department of Highways had set up a system for inspection and remedial work upon rock slopes.  Inspection and recommendations were made by engineers and the work was effected by a rock scaling crew responsible for performing remedial work throughout the entire province.  The department's practice had been to make visual inspections from the highway unless rock falls or a history of instability in an area indicated a need for the rock engineer to climb the slope.  Numerous informal inspections were carried out by highway personnel as they drove along the road.
The trial judge found that the entire system of inspection and the way it was implemented was a policy matter which did not give rise to liability. No finding was made as to whether or not the system of inspection was reasonable or whether the inspections themselves were properly carried out. The Court of Appeal upheld the finding of the trial judge and Just appealled to the Supreme Court.","Is the government under a duty of care to maintain the highways and if so, are they liable if the highways are not sufficiently maintained?","Appeal allowed, new trial ordered.","Cory, writing for the majority, held that the province owes a duty of care, which ordinarily extends to their reasonable maintenance, to those using its highways.  The Department of Highways could readily foresee the risk that harm might befall users of a highway if it were not reasonably maintained.  That maintenance could be found to extend to the prevention of injury from falling rock.
Government agencies may be exempt from the application of the traditional tort law duty of care if an explicit statutory exemption exists or if the decision arose as a result of a policy decision.  Whether or not a decision is characterized as a policy decision or as an operational decision rests on the nature of the decision and not on the identity of the actors.  Generally, decisions concerning budgetary allotments for departments or government agencies should be classified as policy decisions.  A policy decision may be open to challenge on the basis that it is not made in the bona fide exercise of discretion.  If after due consideration it is found that a duty of care is owed by the government agency and no exemption by way of statute or policy decision-making is found to exist, a traditional torts analysis ensues (as per
Anns v Merton London Borough Council
) and the issue of standard of care required of the government agency must next be considered.  The manner and quality of an inspection system, since it was clearly part of the operational aspect of a governmental activity, should be assessed when consideration is given to the standard of care issue.  At this stage, the requisite standard of care must be assessed in light of all the surrounding circumstances including budgetary restraints and the availability of qualified personnel and equipment.
Sopinka, in the dissent, held that the government had the power to carry out the inspections but was under no duty to do so.  Conduct within the limits of this discretion gives rise to no duty of care; conduct outside of these limits may attract a private law duty of care.
A litigant may not attack a policy and it is not appropriate for a Court to pass on it, absent evidence that a policy was adopted for some ulterior motive and not for a municipal purpose.  In order for a private duty to arise, it would have to be shown that the Rockwork Section acted outside its delegated discretion to determine whether to inspect and the manner in which the inspection is to be made.  Policy decisions are immune from review because they usually entail not only a decision to do something but also some call upon the public purse.  The government was acting within its discretion when it decided that inspections should be done and the manner in which they were to be done.  Responsibility for deciding the extent to which the inspection program was to be implemented was delegated to the Rockwork Section.","The duty of care should apply to a public authority unless there is a valid basis for its exclusion.
Policy decisions – the decision by the government about what acts to perform under a given statute – are exempt from liability; operational decisions – the decision by the government about how to perform those acts once they have been decided - are not exempt from liability."
MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,Machtinger v HOJ Industries Ltd.,"A worker, Machtinger, was fired from his job at HOJ Industries Ltd.  The dismissal was based on a decision of the company's management without any formal hearing or investigation into the matter.  The worker was allegedly insubordinate and disruptive.  He was given only oral notification.",Was the dismissal of Machtinger by HOJ Industries Ltd. fair and just?,The dismissal was deemed unfair.,"The court found that the dismissal was procedurally unfair due to the lack of a proper hearing or investigation.  The company did not give Machtinger a chance to respond to the allegations against him, nor was any attempt made to ascertain the true facts of the situation.  The oral nature of the notification and lack of documentation further contributed to the unfairness of the process.",Employers have a duty to act fairly when dismissing employees.  This duty necessitates a fair process that includes an opportunity for the employee to be heard and for the employer to investigate the reasons for dismissal.  A dismissal without a proper hearing constitutes procedural unfairness and is not justifiable.,"Both appellants began working for HOJ Industries, a car dealer, in 1978, and were discharged in 1985 without cause.  At the time they were dismissed Machtinger was credit manager and rust‑proofing sales manager and Lefebvre was sales manager.  Each had entered into a contract for employment for an indefinite period which contained a clause allowing the respondent to terminate his employment without cause, in Machtinger's case without notice and in Lefebvre's case on two weeks' notice.  Under the provincial
Employment Standards Act
the appellants were entitled to a minimum notice period of four weeks.  After they were dismissed, the respondent paid each of them the equivalent of four weeks' salary.  The appellants brought action for wrongful dismissal and the trial judge found that they were entitled to reasonable notice of termination, and that the period of reasonable notice for Machtinger was 7 months and for Lefebvre, 7½ months, however this was overturned by the Court of Appeal.",What should the notice period be in order to terminate employment if notice required in employment contract violates legislated standards?,"Appeal allowed, lower court judgment restored.","McLachlin, writing a concurring judgment, examined the legal principles governing the implication of terms.  She identifies three types of implied terms:
terms implied by fact (intention required);

Liverpool City Council v Irwin
).
She finds that the Court of Appeal erred in characterizing a term implied in law as a term implied in fact, which brought in the intentionality of the parties.  Holding that the employer had a legal obligation to provide reasonable notice and that this can only be displaced by an express contrary agreement, the court imposed a reasonable term of notification on HOJ; HOJ industries.","Terms can be implied by the court based on:

MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,Homex Realty and Development Co. Ltd. v Wyoming (Village),"Homex Realty and Development Co. Ltd. (Homex) sought a variance from the Village of Wyoming's zoning ordinance to construct a larger building than permitted. The ordinance limited building heights and set setbacks, but Homex sought to exceed these limits. Homex's request was denied by the Village. Homex appealed.","Whether the Village's denial of the variance was arbitrary and capricious, and whether the Village Zoning Ordinance was applied fairly and reasonably?",The appeal was denied.,"The court found the Village's denial was supported by substantial evidence.  The Village's zoning ordinance aimed to preserve the neighborhood's character, a goal supported by existing structures and neighborhood standards.  The court found the proposed building was out of scale and would negatively impact the aesthetic qualities and density of the area. The variance, in the court's view, would not serve the public interest. Furthermore, Homex had not demonstrated exceptional and unique circumstances justifying the variance.","A zoning board's decision to deny a variance will be upheld if supported by substantial evidence, and if the decision is based on the reasonable application of the zoning ordinance to the specific circumstances.  A variance is not automatically granted even if the applicant can demonstrate hardship; the variance must also be in the public interest.","As a condition of registration of a plan of subdivision in the Village of Wyoming, Atkinson, the owner and subdivider of the parcel of land, entered into an agreement with the Village for the installation of municipal services in the subdivision. This agreement, dated January 22, 1968, and registered September 26, 1975, provided in a general way for the owner's providing ""all the requirements financial and otherwise, of the Corporation re surfacing of roads, installation of services and drainage"". The agreement also prevented the sale of the lands in question until the agreement had been fully carried out, except with the consent of the Village, but the provision did not provide that consent would operate to release Atkinson from his obligation to the Village. Before any services were installed, Homex bought the great majority of the lots on the subdivision with the Village's consent. There was some question as to whether or not Homex had undertaken to assume the obligations of the original subdivider. Nevertheless, when protracted negotiations between the Village and Homex concerning the installation of services proved fruitless, the Village, in April 1976, pursuant to s. 29(3) (now
s. 50(3)
) of the
Planning Act
and without notice to Homex, enacted by-law 7 deeming the lots purchased by Homex not to be a registered plan of subdivision. Homex, in September 1976, made application for judicial review for an order quashing by-law 7 and, while the application was pending, checkerboarded its lots.
In November 1975, Homex and the Village negotiated the installation of services along the only street requiring them. By-law 6, enacted in December 1975, provided that it was the policy of the Village that it would neither assume responsibility for a water pipeline constructed by Homex nor permit its connection to the municipal water supply system. Homex coupled an application in judicial review to quash by-law 6 with the application for an order to quash by-law 7.","What qualifies as a ""legislative"" decision such that no duty of procedural fairness applies?",Appeal dismissed.,"Estey, writing for the majority, held that while the passage of By-law 7 had some characteristics of a community interest, it was also clearly the culmination of the dispute between the village and Homex.  As a result he found that the decision was quasi-judicial such as to attract the principle of notice and the doctrine of
audi alteram partem
.  Despite this, however, he held that the conduct of Homex to rid itself of the obligations under the agreement with Atkinson were such that it should be denied a discretionary remedy.  There was also no basis to challenge By-law 6 as it simply stated the facts of the agreement with Atkinson.
Dickson, in the dissent, is quoted:
The courts long ago developed the general proposition that wherever a statute authorizes the interference with property or other rights and is silent as to whether or not the agency in question is required to give notice prior to the intervention in such rights, the courts will ""supply the omission of the legislature"" and require the agency in question to afford the subject an opportunity of being heard before it proceeds.
He held that an act could not be labelled ""legislative"" merely for the purpose of dispensing with fairness. It was not particularly important that the function of the municipality was classified as ""legislative"" or ""quasi-judicial"", rather, it was necessary to look at the nature of the function and to the facts of each case. The by-law in question was not of wide and general application, but was rather aimed at deliberately limiting the rights of Homex, entitling it to some procedural safeguards - at a minimum, notice of the proposed by-law and the opportunity to be heard.","In general, the courts have not imposed procedural requirements on the subordinate law-making function.
The facts of each case are key to determining the level of procedural fairness required."

The court held that Bell did not provide sufficient evidence for their claims and also because they misunderstand impartiality - it does not mean having the freedom to decide a case however one wishes to, being subject to certain binding principles is perfectly legitimate for an impartial judiciary.  Further, the Commission cannot create guidelines that favour them in the Tribunal, because to do so would be

In December 1989, after a second four-month wardship, the society brought a status review application seeking an order of Crown wardship without access for the purposes of adoption. CM opposed the motion and the matter was dealt with sporadically throughout 1991. In February 1992 the Ontario Provincial Court ordered that SM be returned to CM on the basis that court intervention was no longer necessary to protect the child. The judge considered CM capable of acquiring the skill to care for her daughter adequately. The society obtained a stay of the order and unsuccessfully appealed to the Ontario Court (General Division). The Court of Appeal granted a stay of the order for return pending appeal and a motion for the introduction of fresh evidence. The new evidence concerned the consistent and repeated assertions of the child that she regarded her foster family as her real family, that she did not want to see her birth mother and that attempts to implement access visits with CM had become almost impossible because of the child's negative reactions - emotional, psychological and physical.  It allowed the appeal, set aside the order for the return of the child to the mother and ordered that the child be made a Crown ward without access for the purposes of adoption. CM appealed to the Supreme Court.",Does the child need continued protection?,Appeal dismissed.,"L'Heureux-Dubé, writing for the court, reviewed the case law and determined that when a court is determining whether the wardship should be terminated or continue, the judge should not determine whether an order of wardship should have been made in the previous or earlier hearings, but instead
now
consider whether continuation of the wardship in the current proceedings is in the best interests of the child without overlooking the parents' rights.  The review hearing is not about retrying the original need for a protection order, but rather the court should determine the circumstances of the parents or parent since the last order as it relates to the situation with respect to the child's custody, including their physical, mental and emotional state since that time and also whether there is now a lifestyle, including attitudes of the parent, that warrants the child being returned to the parent or to wardship.
She lays out a two part test:
Does the child continue to need protection and require a court order for protection?
The children's aid society must continue to justify its intervention by showing that a court order is necessary to protect the child in the future.  This does not mean that an absence of proof of a deficiency in the parent's parenting capacity is enough to return the child to the parent.  A court order may be necessary to protect the child from emotional harm which would result in future if the child were taken from its psychological parents.
What is in the best interests of the children?
This should be decided through a balancing of the considerations such as the importance of the continuity of care, the child’s physical/emotional/psychological needs, the benefit of a child's bond to his/her biological parent, as well as psychological bonding of child to his/her foster family.
The furtherance and protection of the child’s best interests must take priority over the desires and interests of the parent.
The question is not merely whether the parent has seen the light and is now prepared to be a good parent, but whether or not the parent has, in factk turned a new leaf and whether he or she is now able to give to the children the care they require?

Between the lack of bonding with the birth mother and the bonding with the foster family, it would be in the best interests of the child to be made a ward of the respondent society, with a view to her adoption by her foster family.",Two stage test for review of a protection order.

(Lea) for the design and construction of a building.  A dispute arose regarding the quality of the work and the cost.  Edgeworth alleged that Lea's work was substandard, resulting in significant delays and extra costs. Lea contended that the issues were due to Edgeworth's own errors and changes in specifications.  Details of the specific defects and disagreements are not provided.","Was N.D.

The court awarded monetary compensation to Edgeworth, but not the full amount claimed.","The court found that Lea was responsible for some of the defects in the construction work, and that these defects caused delays and extra costs for Edgeworth.  The evidence presented supported the conclusion that the delays and additional expense stemmed from Lea's substandard work,  but also from issues arising out of Edgeworth's own actions or omissions.  The court specifically addressed the specific areas in which Lea was found liable, detailing the amounts and specific reasons behind the compensation awarded.","A construction contractor (like Lea) can be held liable for defects in its work, even if the client (like Edgeworth) contributed to the problems, but the extent of that liability depends on the specific facts of each case.

MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,Miglin v Miglin,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,"The parties were married for 14 years and had four children. They operated a resort lodge in Algonquin Park in the summer and lived in Toronto in the winter. Both parties worked in the business; the husband handled the finance and the wife the day-to-day operation of the lodge. When they separated in 1993, both parties were in their early 40s and all the children were under 8 years old. The wife wanted to stay home with the children given their ages. After around fifteen months of negotiation, the parties signed an agreement, wherein:
the husband kept the lodge and his start-up business;
the wife kept the matrimonial home in Toronto (worth approximately the same as the lodge at $250,000);
the husband would pay $60,000/year in child support;
a consulting agreement providing the wife with $15,000/year for five years, renewable on consent; and
a full and final release of any future spousal support claims.
After the divorce judgment was issued in 1997, the wife's childcare obligations changed and the consulting agreement was not renewed. She applied to the court for relief, including spousal support. The trial judge referred to the husband as ""manipulative"" and ""obsessive"". The application was allowed, child support was brought in line with the
Guidelines
and the wife was awarded support of $4,400/month for five years. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment regarding spousal support, and the husband was given leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.",When should a support agreement be upheld by the courts?,Appeal allowed; original support order stands.,"Arbour and Bastarache, writing for the majority, stress finality and certainty as key principles in support agreements, citing
s. 9 of the
Divorce Act
; these are contracts and as long as they were entered into openly, the courts should enforce them.
They state that when considering whether to uphold a support agreement, there is a two stage analysis:
The formation of the agreement
: was the agreement ""unimpeachably negotiated""?
Factors to consider:
representation by counsel: the degree of professional assistance received by the party is relevant, but a court should not presume an imbalance of power.
circumstances: was one or both parties vulnerable and if so, did presence of counsel rectify this vulnerability?
duration of negotiations: was the agreement negotiated over a reasonable amount of time?
Substance of the agreement: does the agreement remain in substantial compliance with the objectives of the
Divorce Act
?
The analysis should not be restricted to the spousal support component – look at the whole agreement; the agreement as a whole should substantially comply with the factors and objectives of the
Act
(including the principles of certainty, autonomy and finality).
An agreement can be modified to bring it in line with the principles in the
Act
.
Agreement's correspondence to the parties' original intentions
: were the current circumstances anticipated when the agreement was drafted?
Foreseeability is interpreted broadly; circumstances do not have to have been explicitly considered/contemplated

Generally, where negotiation of the agreement was correct and the agreement remains in substantial compliance with the
Act
, the court should defer to the wishes of the party and accord the agreement great weight.
Applying this to the case at bar:
Both parties had engaged the services of expert counsel and negotiations persisted over a lengthy period. Although the husband may have been the dominant party, the wife had adequate counsel; there was no hint of any vulnerabilities that might not be compensated by counsel.
The quantum of child support established in the agreement intended to provide the wife with a minimum amount of income in contemplation of her not working. While the wife argues that the business generates income, this was accounted for when the assets were valued and divided. The consulting contract reflects the parties' intention to provide the wife with a source of employment income for a limited time. The wife chose not to go back to the workforce, and had substantial assets even without support; there was no hardship or long-term disadvantage.
In the result, the original order should stand.
LeBel and Deschamps, in the dissent, stress very different concepts: interdependence and unequal bargaining power.  They propose a simpler test; is the agreement objectively unfair when considered now?
The dissenters disagree with the majority in two key areas.  One, the presence of counsel may not be enough to negate a power imbalance, and two, that very little deference should be given to agreements that deviate from the objectives in
s. 15.2(6)
of the
Act
; any fair agreement should reasonably realize the four stated objectives.","Establishes the test for enforcement of support agreements.

While in the 27th week of pregnancy she was driving her car when her negligent actions caused a car accident.  The fetus was permanently injured, and was born prematurely that day.  Her son, Ryan Dobson, suffered physical and mental injuries, including cerebral palsy.  His grandfather launched a tort claim for damages against his mother.  Ryan was successful at the Court of Appeal, which his mother appealed.",Should a mother be liable in tort for damages to her child arising from a prenatal negligent act that allegedly injured the fetus in her womb?,Appeal allowed.,"Cory, writing for the majority, finds that the mother should not be held liable in the situation because of the policy implications.  They employ the
Kamloops
test to determine if a duty of care should be owed.  It has two parts:
Is the relationship between the two parties close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there any public policy implications that should negate or limit the scope of the duty?
They find that the first part is satisfied; however the public policy implications negate the duty.  They state that there are two main reasons for this: it would violate the privacy and autonomy of women, and it is impossible to judicially define a reasonable standard of conduct for pregnant women.
McLachlin, in a concurring judgment, states that another main reason why this duty cannot be imposed is that it would violate pregnant women's rights under the
Charter
– specifically liberty and equality.  They would lose their liberty, and not be treated equally with other women in society.
Major, in the dissent, states that in order for the public policy implications to negate the duty they must add new restrictions on what the woman can do.  He says that this is not the case, because she had a duty of care to everyone else on the road, and extending that to the foetus would not change the reasonable standard of her conduct.  He says that this case deals specifically with pregnant women driving automobiles, and if the creation of duty imposed a limitation on her actions that was not there previously then the outcome would be different.  He uses the example with another pregnant woman in the car – if the same outcome occurred, then there is no question that the other woman's foetus could sue her for negligence.  He agrees that the
Kamloops
test applies, but says that the policy implications here do not negate the duty.","Pregnant women do not owe a duty of care to the foetus in their womb.

The provincial government denied the existence of such title and argued it had been extinguished by colonial legislation and actions.","Did Aboriginal title exist at common law in British Columbia, and if so, had it been extinguished by the Crown before the trial?","The appeal was dismissed due to a 3-3 split among the participating judges on the question of extinguishment and a procedural ruling by one justice. However, a majority (6 of 7) of the judges recognized the existence of Aboriginal title at common law in Canada.","A majority of the Court held that Aboriginal title existed at common law as a sui generis right predating European settlement. They reasoned that this title was not extinguished by the mere assertion of Crown sovereignty but required a 'clear and plain' intention by the Crown, typically through legislation, to extinguish it. The judges were split on whether the historical actions and legislation of the Crown in British Columbia demonstrated such a clear and plain intention in this specific case. The seventh judge based his decision against the appellants on a procedural ground (failure to obtain a fiat).","Aboriginal title existed at common law in Canada independently of statute or proclamation, and was not extinguished by the mere assertion of Crown sovereignty. Extinguishment of Aboriginal title required a clear and plain intention by the Crown.","The appellants are representative of the Nishga Tribe of British Columbia.  They claim that the aboriginal title over a piece of land in British Columbia that had been present before Confederation had never been extinguished, and that the tribe therefore still had title to the land.  This claim was denied at trial and upheld at appeal.","Do the alleged aboriginal land claims exist?

The Supreme Court holds that aboriginal title definitely exists, however they were split over whether or not it had been extinguished.  The majority decided that it has been extinguished by virtue of the government's exercise of control over the lands, and therefore the appeal is dismissed.  However, the dissenting judges disagree and state that more must be present to prove that the lands were extinguished.  They say that the provincial government did not have any constitutional right to deal with the land of the aboriginals, and that their predecessors before confederation did not do anything that could amount to extinguishing the lands.","Recognition of aboriginal title.

The parens patriae jurisdiction is for the protection and therapeutic benefit of the ward, not to authorize non-therapeutic procedures primarily for the convenience of others. Authorizing such a procedure under this jurisdiction would constitute a serious infringement on the ward's bodily integrity and fundamental human rights and is not within the scope of the court's power acting in the ward's ""best interests"" in this context.","The parens patriae jurisdiction of the court cannot be used to authorize the non-therapeutic sterilization of a mentally incompetent person incapable of consent, as it is a drastic, irreversible procedure that infringes fundamental rights and is not for the therapeutic benefit or protection of the ward in the context of this jurisdiction.","Eve was a 24 year-old mentally disabled woman living in PEI with a condition that made it very difficult for her to communicate with others.

There was considerable evidence that the daughter would be incapable of handling the burdens of motherhood.  Eve had struck up a friendship with a boy from school, and discussed marriage, and her mother is afraid of the burden that would be placed on Eve, and ultimately upon herself to look after a child if pregnancy ensued.  Permission was denied at trial, but granted at the Court of Appeal.",Can a caregiver for someone incapable of giving informed consent make decisions about surgeries for the incapable individual?,Appeal allowed.,"La Forest, writing for a unanimous court, discusses the history of
parens patriae
jurisdiction, which states that the state is responsible for decisions concerning those that cannot give informed consent themselves. He says that the test is generally that the only procedures that will be allowed are ones that are in the ""best interests"" of the protected person. He focuses his criticism in this case on the fact that Mrs. E. is claiming that the burden on her to look after the child should be considered in making the decision. La Forest states that this should be given no consideration, as it is only the best interests of the protected person that are of concern.
He also says that arguing about the protected person's fitness as a parents involves value-loaded questions that result in a designation of disabled persons as less competent parents, even though there is significant evidence showing that they show as much fondness and concern for their children as anyone else. He also considers that the procedure of a hysterectomy is serious surgery and quite invasive, and further that Eve does not require assistance caring for her reproductive cycle, which is a concern in other cases. Perhaps most importantly, this surgery is not therapeutic.
La Forest concludes that ""the grave intrusion on a person’s rights and the certain physical damage that ensues from non-therapeutic sterilization without consent, when compared to the highly questionable advantages that can result, [show that] it can never safely be determined that such a procedure is for the benefit of the person."" The procedure should never be authorized for non-therapeutic purposes under the

She failed this specific component twice. Statistical evidence indicated that women, on average, were less likely to pass this test than men due to physiological differences. Meiorin was subsequently laid off due to her failure to meet the standard. She filed a complaint alleging discrimination based on sex under the BC Human Rights Act.","Did the employer's physical fitness standard, which had an adverse impact on women, constitute a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR) and therefore not be discriminatory?","The Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the appeal, upholding the Human Rights Tribunal decision that the fitness standard was discriminatory and not a bona fide occupational requirement.","The Court established a new, unified test for determining a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR), applicable to both direct and adverse effect discrimination. The employer must demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that the standard: 1) was adopted for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job; 2) was adopted in an honest belief that it was necessary to the fulfillment of that legitimate work-related purpose; and 3) is reasonably necessary to accomplish that legitimate work-related purpose, meaning it is impossible to accommodate individual employees sharing the characteristics of the claimant without imposing undue hardship upon the employer. While the first two criteria might have been met, the employer failed the third. The employer did not demonstrate that the specific standard (the 11-minute run) was necessary to safely perform the job or that accommodating individual capabilities (such as using a different aerobic capacity test or standard) would cause undue hardship. The standard was not tailored to individual abilities but based on an average, disproportionately disadvantaging women.","The test for a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR) is a unified test requiring the employer to demonstrate that the standard is rationally connected to the job, adopted in good faith, and reasonably necessary, including proving that individual accommodation without undue hardship is impossible.

Three children were born in the course of a common law relationship. After separation the children lived with the mother, and some months later the father paid $150 in child support pursuant to a maintenance agreement which was increased to $300/month following a consent order.  The mother brought an action for retroactive support.  The father had low income and high access costs and resisted the action.  The chambers judge held retroactive support would constitute hardship.
Parents married in 1984 and divorced in 1991. After separation the two children lived with their mother and a divorce judgment ordered the father to pay $700/month in child support.  In 2000 the mother signaled an intention to request increased support.  The father voluntarily increased his payments, but still below the table amount.  The mother was unaware that his income had increased dramatically as they lived in different cities.  At chambers, the judge granted her application for retroactive support based on the table amount, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal in a 2-1 judgment.
Parents divorced in 1996.  The children lived with the father, then one of the children moved to lived with the mother.  The father had a lot more income and the mother asked for an increase of support but the father rejected the request.  The mother was hesitant to take the case to court because earlier proceedings had caused a rift between the mother and children.  The chambers judge held that this was an appropriate circumstance for a retroactive award, and he calculated it from January 1, 2003 onward, to be paid in the amount of $500/month, as a ""reasonable compromise"" that best fit the situation of the parties.

To prevent liability for retroactive support, any changes in income should be reported to the custodial parent.  If this is not done and an application is brought to enforce a change, four factors should be analysed to see if retroactive support is warranted:
Undue delay: does the recipient have a reasonable excuse for not seeking support earlier?
Any voluntary, intentional choice not to apply for an increase will militate against retroactive support.  There is a balancing here; a child should not be punished for a poor choice of the parent.
Was there blameworthy conduct on the part of the payor?
This is interpreted broadly; anything that privileges the payor's interests over his/her children's right to an appropriate amount of support.
Could the payor have reasonably believed that they were discharging their support obligations?
The more significant a change in income, the more likely a court will find a payor's behaviour blameworthy if they do not proactively disclose.
Need of child/benefit: would the child benefit from retroactive award based on their needs/circumstances?
If a child's needs are being met by the current support, this will militate against a retroactive award.
Would a retroactive award cause hardship to payor?
This is a distinct element from the
s. 10
undue hardship test.
Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.

Turning to how far back retroactive payments should go, it turns on the conduct of the parents.  If there was no blameworthy behaviour, the retroactivity should go to when the custodial parent informs the payor that they are seeking additional support.  Generally there will be a limit of 3 years.  For blameworthy parents, the retroactivity should continue to when the support should have changed and did not, without limit.
As to the amount of a retroactive payment, the court should follow the
Guidelines
, but the court has broad discretion to craft a remedy that would be fair having regard to all the circumstances, including hardship on the payor.
Applying this to the cases...
This was an initial application for child support.  The parents had a shared custody arrangement that thought that meant no child support was payable (see
Contino v Leonelli-Contino
).  The incomes of the parents were relatively equal and due to the shared custody any money going to one household would simply be removed from the other.  Due to the lack of blameworthy conduct and the lack of benefit to the children, no retroactive support was awarded.
The father from whom support was being sought was low income (~$23,000/year) and he was supporting a second family.  Any retroactive award would cause his household hardship.  The access costs for him were also high.  Because of the lack of blameworthy conduct, the hardship a retroactive award would cause, and the fact that the standard of living in the custodial household was higher, no retroactive support was awarded.
In this case, the mother had broached the subject with the father but could not afford a lawyer to fight the case.  She was intimidated by her ex-husband and did not know much about his financial situation as he lived in another city.  The husband had had a huge income increase and held it from her, as well as saying that she should have managed her money better to better provide for their kids and that he was paying all he could afford.  Due to the large amount of blameworthy conduct and the large discrepancy in the amount he was paying and the table amount, the court awarded $100,000 in retroactive support.
As in
Henry
, the parties had very different incomes; the father earned more than $100,000K/year, much more than the mother, and he gave no financial support when the need arose.  The mother said she had not wanted to litigate because of the effect it had had on her daughter the last time they litigated.  The court held that the delay of mother was not unreasonable, and the father had no reasonable grounds on which to believe the level of support he was paying was reasonable, and thus the award granted at trial was upheld.
Abella, dissenting in part, had three issues with the decision of Bastarache.
The presumptive starting date of effective notice: the payor has the information on when their income changes, so it is impractical and unrealistic to expect the recipient to keep tabs on the payor’s income; the date should be when the income changes.

GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,O'Grady v Sparling,"The appellant was charged under a provincial Highway Traffic Act with having care or control of a motor vehicle while intoxicated or under the influence of a drug. The charge was laid under a provincial statute that mirrored a similar charge under the federal Criminal Code, but which carried a less severe penalty. The appellant argued that the provincial legislation was ultra vires (beyond the power of) the province because it encroached on the federal power over criminal law.","Does a provincial statute making it an offence to have care or control of a motor vehicle while intoxicated or under the influence of a drug conflict with or invade the field of federal criminal law, rendering the provincial statute ultra vires the provincial legislature?",The Supreme Court of Canada held that the provincial legislation was intra vires (within the power of) the provincial legislature.,"The Court found that the provincial legislation was regulatory in nature, aimed at highway traffic control and safety, which is a valid provincial objective. Although the provincial offence was similar to the federal criminal offence, it did not have the same 'criminal' purpose (prohibition plus penalty for a public wrong) but rather a regulatory one (ensuring safe driving conditions on provincial highways). The court applied the 'pith and substance' doctrine, determining the true character of the legislation was in relation to highway regulation, a provincial matter. The court also indicated that there was no direct conflict or 'occupying the field' issue because the purposes of the two pieces of legislation, while covering similar conduct, were distinct (criminal vs. regulatory).","A provincial statute dealing with the regulation of highway traffic and safety, even if it prohibits conduct also prohibited by the Criminal Code, is valid provincial legislation if its true 'pith and substance' is aimed at highway regulation and not the creation of a criminal offence aimed at punishing a public wrong. The provincial power over highway regulation is distinct from the federal power over criminal law.","O'Grady was charged under s. 55(1) of the Manitoba
Highway Traffic Act
(now
s. 188
) which prohibited driving ""on a highway without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway"". The defendant challenged the law, claiming that it was beyond the power of the province because the federal government had ""occupied the field"" with a similar criminal provision in ss. 191/221 (now
s. 219
) of the
Criminal Code
, which prohibited driving with ""wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons"".  O'Grady was convicted at trial and an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba was dismissed.","Are provincial laws relating to negligence with penal consequences criminal law and therefore
ultra vires
the province?",Appeal dismissed.,"Judson, writing for the majority, held that ""the power of a provincial legislature to enact legislation for the regulation of highway traffic is undoubted"".  He reaffirmed the principle that there exists a ""general area"" or ""domain"" of criminal law and the two governments can make law on the same matter by creating a distinction between the types of culpability.  He quotes from Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law:
There are only two states of mind which constitute
mens rea
, and they are intention and recklessness. The difference between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; they are opposed and it is a logical fallacy to suggest that recklessness is a degree of negligence. The common habit of lawyers to qualify the word ""negligence"" with some moral epithet such as ""wicked"", ""gross"", or ""culpable"" has been most unfortunate since it has inevitably led to great confusion of thought and of principle. It is equally misleading to speak of criminal negligence since this is merely to use an expression to explain itself.
On the facts, Judson found that there was overlap between the laws however ""there is no conflict between these provisions in the sense that they are repugnant"". The provincial law extended to include ""inadvertent negligence"" as well as regular negligence. It was enough that “the two pieces of legislation differed both in legislative purpose and legal and practical effect” to justify both of them.","The distinction between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; recklessness is when an actor does not desire harmful consequences but forsees the possibility and consciously takes the risk.
There must be an operational incompatibility between federal and provincial law to invoke paramountcy."
GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,Canada (Attorney General) v Mossup,"An employee, Ms. Mossup, claimed sick leave benefits under a collective agreement for an absence from work allegedly due to stress and anxiety caused by harassment and bullying in the workplace. The employer (Attorney General of Canada) denied the claim, arguing that psychological stress resulting from workplace conditions did not constitute an 'illness' or 'injury' within the meaning of the collective agreement.","Does a psychological condition, such as stress and anxiety, caused by workplace conditions (specifically harassment and bullying), constitute an 'illness' or 'injury' entitling an employee to sick leave benefits under a collective agreement?","Yes. The Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the Attorney General's appeal, upholding the lower court's decision that Ms. Mossup was entitled to sick leave benefits.","The Court interpreted the terms 'illness' and 'injury' in the collective agreement broadly. It held that these terms are not restricted to physical conditions but can include psychological conditions that are medically supported and prevent an employee from performing their job duties. The focus is on the employee's incapacity to work due to a medically recognized condition, regardless of whether the cause is physical or psychological resulting from workplace stressors. The Court found that the collective agreement language did not exclude psychological conditions caused by the workplace environment.","Psychological conditions, including stress and anxiety, resulting from workplace harassment or other stressors can constitute an 'illness' or 'injury' for the purpose of qualifying for sick leave benefits under a collective agreement, provided there is medical evidence supporting the condition and its impact on the employee's ability to work.","Mossop is a gay man, and his partner's father died.  He applied to take bereavement leave from his job to go to the funeral, but is denied because his partner is neither a ""spouse"" nor a ""common law partner"" as they are both required to be of the opposite sex.  He makes a claim to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, but refuses to argue sexual orientation as a ground, and instead will only argue family status, stating that all matters to do with homosexuals are not about sexual orientation by definition.  The case was dismissed in the lower courts.","Can a homosexual man claim discrimination against ""family status"" with his partner under

However, Mossop sticks with family status.  The majority says that you cannot interpret ""family status"" to include Mossop’s situation unless you also discuss the ground of sexual orientation, and as Mossop refuses to do so he cannot be successful.
La Forest
concurs, but instead looks to the definitions in the Act and tries to figure out what the government meant to protect under ""family status"".  He determines that this specific field was not intended to be covered.
In the dissent,
L'Heureux-Dubé
says that ""family status"" should have a very broad interpretation.  She looks to the broader social context of limiting it as the majority does, and further that by looking at the plain meaning given in the statute you are really just taking the majority's opinion of the definition, which is exactly what you try to avoid in human rights issues.  She also suggests that when there are overlapping grounds, you should select the one that will succeed and proceed with that one.","Only identified grounds can be pursued in a human rights claim.
Definitions in human rights legislation are generally interpreted broadly, but the definition given by Parliament in the statute has a good deal of authority in the court's decision on what falls under the definition and what does not."
GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v British Columbia (Council of Human Rights) (Re Grismer Estate),"Donald Grismer, who had a visual impairment (hemianopia) resulting from a stroke, had his driver's license cancelled by the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles. The cancellation was based on a general medical standard requiring 20/50 visual acuity and 120 degrees of peripheral vision. Grismer argued he could drive safely using compensatory strategies and that the cancellation was discrimination based on disability under the BC Human Rights Act. The BC Human Rights Council found discrimination, which was upheld by the lower courts.","Did the Superintendent's cancellation of Grismer's driver's license based on a general visual standard, without considering his individual ability to drive safely using compensatory strategies, constitute discrimination on the basis of disability that could not be justified as a bona fide and reasonable requirement?",The Supreme Court of Canada upheld the finding of discrimination. The Superintendent failed to establish that the blanket visual standard was a bona fide and reasonable justification.,"Applying the three-step Meiorin test for bona fide and reasonable justification, the Court found that while the purpose of the standard (highway safety) was rationally connected and the standard was adopted in good faith (steps 1 and 2 met), the Superintendent failed the third step. The standard was not reasonably necessary because it did not allow for individual assessment or accommodation of drivers who could demonstrate safe driving abilities despite not meeting the general standard. There was no evidence that accommodating individuals like Grismer would cause undue hardship.","A blanket safety standard based on a group characteristic (like a medical condition or disability) is discriminatory if it does not accommodate individual differences to the point of undue hardship. To be a bona fide and reasonable justification, a standard must allow for individual assessment or accommodation where it is possible for an individual, despite not meeting the general rule, to safely perform the essential requirement (driving) through other means, such as compensatory strategies.","The Government of British Columbia had a policy stating that it would not issue licenses to people suffering from a condition (homonymous hemianopsia (HH)) which affected eyesight.  The claimant had this condition but had driven flawlessly at work and on public roads using ""prism glasses"".  Despite this he was refused individual assessment and was not allowed to receive a license and was therefore unable to complete his job.  The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal allowed Grismer to be individually tested.  Grismer died shortly after this decision.  This was upheld by the British Columbia Supreme Court but overruled by the Court of Appeal.",Does an absolute prohibition on licensing people with a visual impairment without the possibility of individual assessment constitute discrimination?,"Appeal allowed, standard disallowed.","The court applies the
Meiorin
test, showing that it can be used in scenarios outside of the workplace to determine if discrimination is justified.  This case passes the first part because the purpose of the standard (reasonable safety) is rationally connected to the function (issuing drivers’ licenses).  It also passes the second step because there is no evidence that the standard (no licenses for HH sufferers) was adopted for any reasons other than road safety.  However the case fails the third step as the court finds that the standard (no licenses for HH) is not reasonably necessary for the purpose (reasonable safety).  The blanket prohibition doesn't let people even attempt to show that they can drive safely.
It is clear here that the accommodation would be to allow testing.  In order to succeed the government would have had to prove that to allow testing would result to undue hardship which they failed to do.  Although there are clearly safety and cost concerns involved with testing, the government didn't put in any effort to determine these values, nor did they even look for alternative ways of testing.  The court also says that in general, with the government, costs must be exorbitant to amount to undue hardship, as they are publicly funded and this would be seen as being in the public interest.  As the standard is not rationally necessary for the purpose of reasonable road safety, it amounts to discrimination and must be removed.","The
Meiorin
test applies to all standards that are thought to be discriminatory, even if they do not occur in a workplace; called bona fide justification tests.
The government will be held to a very high threshold when claiming that the costs of not adopting a standard amount to undue hardship as they are publicly funded and preventing discrimination is in the public interest."
GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,Just v British Columbia,"The plaintiff was injured when a boulder rolled onto a highway maintained by the defendant, causing the plaintiff's vehicle to crash. The defendant, the province of British Columbia, had a system for inspecting slopes but did not inspect the particular slope, which was known to be unstable. The plaintiff sued for negligence, alleging failure to adequately inspect and maintain the highway.","Did the provincial government owe a duty of care to highway users in its decisions regarding the inspection and maintenance of highways, and if so, was it liable for negligence for failing to adequately inspect a known unstable slope? Specifically, were decisions about inspection and maintenance policy decisions immune from liability or operational decisions subject to a duty of care?",The Supreme Court of Canada held that the province owed a duty of care in its operational decisions regarding highway inspection and maintenance and was liable for negligence.,"The Court distinguished between policy decisions (high-level, discretionary, generally immune from liability) and operational decisions (implementing policy, subject to a duty of care). Decisions about the system of inspection and maintenance, once the decision to build and maintain the highway was made, were operational. The failure to adequately inspect the known unstable slope constituted a breach of this operational duty of care, resulting in foreseeable harm to the plaintiff.","A government body responsible for maintaining public infrastructure owes a duty of care to users in its operational decisions regarding inspection and maintenance. While policy decisions (e.g., resource allocation for maintenance) may be immune from negligence claims, the operational execution of maintenance and inspection duties is subject to a standard of reasonableness, and a failure to meet this standard can give rise to liability in negligence.","Heavy snow fall forced Just and his daughter to stop in a line of traffic by a rocky slope on a major highway.  A boulder, which worked loose from the wooded slopes above the highway, came crashing down on the appellant's car, killing the appellant's daughter and causing him very serious injuries.  Just brought an action against the provincial government contending that the government negligently failed to properly maintain the highway.
The Department of Highways had set up a system for inspection and remedial work upon rock slopes.  Inspection and recommendations were made by engineers and the work was effected by a rock scaling crew responsible for performing remedial work throughout the entire province.  The department's practice had been to make visual inspections from the highway unless rock falls or a history of instability in an area indicated a need for the rock engineer to climb the slope.  Numerous informal inspections were carried out by highway personnel as they drove along the road.
The trial judge found that the entire system of inspection and the way it was implemented was a policy matter which did not give rise to liability. No finding was made as to whether or not the system of inspection was reasonable or whether the inspections themselves were properly carried out. The Court of Appeal upheld the finding of the trial judge and Just appealled to the Supreme Court.","Is the government under a duty of care to maintain the highways and if so, are they liable if the highways are not sufficiently maintained?","Appeal allowed, new trial ordered.","Cory, writing for the majority, held that the province owes a duty of care, which ordinarily extends to their reasonable maintenance, to those using its highways.  The Department of Highways could readily foresee the risk that harm might befall users of a highway if it were not reasonably maintained.  That maintenance could be found to extend to the prevention of injury from falling rock.
Government agencies may be exempt from the application of the traditional tort law duty of care if an explicit statutory exemption exists or if the decision arose as a result of a policy decision.  Whether or not a decision is characterized as a policy decision or as an operational decision rests on the nature of the decision and not on the identity of the actors.  Generally, decisions concerning budgetary allotments for departments or government agencies should be classified as policy decisions.  A policy decision may be open to challenge on the basis that it is not made in the bona fide exercise of discretion.  If after due consideration it is found that a duty of care is owed by the government agency and no exemption by way of statute or policy decision-making is found to exist, a traditional torts analysis ensues (as per
Anns v Merton London Borough Council
) and the issue of standard of care required of the government agency must next be considered.  The manner and quality of an inspection system, since it was clearly part of the operational aspect of a governmental activity, should be assessed when consideration is given to the standard of care issue.  At this stage, the requisite standard of care must be assessed in light of all the surrounding circumstances including budgetary restraints and the availability of qualified personnel and equipment.
Sopinka, in the dissent, held that the government had the power to carry out the inspections but was under no duty to do so.  Conduct within the limits of this discretion gives rise to no duty of care; conduct outside of these limits may attract a private law duty of care.
A litigant may not attack a policy and it is not appropriate for a Court to pass on it, absent evidence that a policy was adopted for some ulterior motive and not for a municipal purpose.  In order for a private duty to arise, it would have to be shown that the Rockwork Section acted outside its delegated discretion to determine whether to inspect and the manner in which the inspection is to be made.  Policy decisions are immune from review because they usually entail not only a decision to do something but also some call upon the public purse.  The government was acting within its discretion when it decided that inspections should be done and the manner in which they were to be done.  Responsibility for deciding the extent to which the inspection program was to be implemented was delegated to the Rockwork Section.","The duty of care should apply to a public authority unless there is a valid basis for its exclusion.
Policy decisions – the decision by the government about what acts to perform under a given statute – are exempt from liability; operational decisions – the decision by the government about how to perform those acts once they have been decided - are not exempt from liability."
GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,Machtinger v HOJ Industries Ltd.,"The appellants, Machtinger and Lefebvre, were employees of HOJ Industries Ltd. Both were terminated without cause after relatively short periods of employment (Machtinger 23 months, Lefebvre 33 months). Their written employment contracts contained termination clauses specifying a fixed notice period (Machtinger: 2 weeks, Lefebvre: 4 weeks) which was less than what would be considered reasonable notice at common law. The contractual notice periods were also less than the minimum notice required by the Ontario Employment Standards Act (ESA) *at the time of termination* for employees of their tenure, rendering the contractual clauses invalid under the ESA.","If an employment contract contains an express term specifying a period of notice for termination without cause, but that term provides for less notice than the minimum required by the applicable employment standards legislation (thus being void), does this invalid express term displace the implied common law term requiring reasonable notice?",The Supreme Court of Canada held that the invalid contractual termination clause did not displace the implied common law right to reasonable notice. The employees were entitled to reasonable notice at common law.,"The Court reasoned that the minimum notice periods established by employment standards legislation (like the ESA) represent a floor beneath which parties cannot contract. An employer cannot contract out of these minimum standards. If an express term in an employment contract regarding termination provides for less than the statutory minimum notice, that term is void and of no effect.  A void contractual term cannot be used to displace the implied common law term of reasonable notice. If the express term is void, it is as if no agreement was reached on termination notice, and the implied term of reasonable notice at common law applies by default. The common law provides the 'gap filler' when a specific, legally compliant, contractual provision is absent or void.","Where a termination clause in an employment contract provides for less than the minimum notice period required by the applicable employment standards legislation, that clause is void for failing to comply with the legislation, and the employee is entitled to reasonable notice at common law.","Both appellants began working for HOJ Industries, a car dealer, in 1978, and were discharged in 1985 without cause.  At the time they were dismissed Machtinger was credit manager and rust‑proofing sales manager and Lefebvre was sales manager.  Each had entered into a contract for employment for an indefinite period which contained a clause allowing the respondent to terminate his employment without cause, in Machtinger's case without notice and in Lefebvre's case on two weeks' notice.  Under the provincial
Employment Standards Act
the appellants were entitled to a minimum notice period of four weeks.  After they were dismissed, the respondent paid each of them the equivalent of four weeks' salary.  The appellants brought action for wrongful dismissal and the trial judge found that they were entitled to reasonable notice of termination, and that the period of reasonable notice for Machtinger was 7 months and for Lefebvre, 7½ months, however this was overturned by the Court of Appeal.",What should the notice period be in order to terminate employment if notice required in employment contract violates legislated standards?,"Appeal allowed, lower court judgment restored.","McLachlin, writing a concurring judgment, examined the legal principles governing the implication of terms.  She identifies three types of implied terms:
terms implied by fact (intention required);
terms implied by law (no intention required); and
terms implied by custom and usage,
and identifies #2 as the type the courts will read into a contract.  Implication of law can be from custom, for business efficiency (what is necessary in a contract), or what is reasonable (from Denning's dissent in
Liverpool City Council v Irwin
).
She finds that the Court of Appeal erred in characterizing a term implied in law as a term implied in fact, which brought in the intentionality of the parties.  Holding that the employer had a legal obligation to provide reasonable notice and that this can only be displaced by an express contrary agreement, the court imposed a reasonable term of notification on HOJ; HOJ industries.","Terms can be implied by the court based on:
custom or usage;
if necessary for business efficacy;
legal incidents of a particular class of contract."
GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,Homex Realty and Development Co. Ltd. v Wyoming (Village),"Homex Realty and Development Co. Ltd. entered into a development agreement with the Village of Wyoming for a subdivision. A dispute arose between the parties regarding servicing costs and completion of works. The Village subsequently passed bylaws preventing further development and refused to issue building permits to Homex, citing the unresolved dispute. Homex sued the Village for damages resulting from the delay and interference with its development plans, arguing the bylaws were invalid. The Village counterclaimed for amounts it alleged Homex owed under the agreement.","Did the Village of Wyoming have the legal authority to pass bylaws and refuse building permits for the improper purpose of compelling Homex to settle a contractual dispute, or were these actions an unlawful use of municipal power?",The Supreme Court of Canada held that the Village's bylaws and refusal to issue permits were unlawful and constituted a breach of the development agreement and unlawful interference with Homex's economic interests. Homex was entitled to damages.,"The Court found that the Village's actions were *ultra vires* (beyond its powers) because the bylaws were passed for an improper purpose – specifically, to gain leverage in a contractual dispute rather than for legitimate planning or regulatory objectives. Municipalities cannot use their regulatory powers to enforce private contractual obligations. The bylaws were deemed invalid, and the refusal to issue permits based on these bylaws was unlawful. This constituted a breach of the agreement and an actionable wrong causing damages to Homex.","A municipality cannot use its regulatory bylaw-making power or permit-issuing authority for an ulterior or improper purpose, such as compelling a party to settle a contractual dispute. Bylaws or actions taken for such an improper purpose are *ultra vires* and invalid, potentially leading to liability for damages caused by the unlawful interference with a party's rights.","As a condition of registration of a plan of subdivision in the Village of Wyoming, Atkinson, the owner and subdivider of the parcel of land, entered into an agreement with the Village for the installation of municipal services in the subdivision. This agreement, dated January 22, 1968, and registered September 26, 1975, provided in a general way for the owner's providing ""all the requirements financial and otherwise, of the Corporation re surfacing of roads, installation of services and drainage"". The agreement also prevented the sale of the lands in question until the agreement had been fully carried out, except with the consent of the Village, but the provision did not provide that consent would operate to release Atkinson from his obligation to the Village. Before any services were installed, Homex bought the great majority of the lots on the subdivision with the Village's consent. There was some question as to whether or not Homex had undertaken to assume the obligations of the original subdivider. Nevertheless, when protracted negotiations between the Village and Homex concerning the installation of services proved fruitless, the Village, in April 1976, pursuant to s. 29(3) (now
s. 50(3)
) of the
Planning Act
and without notice to Homex, enacted by-law 7 deeming the lots purchased by Homex not to be a registered plan of subdivision. Homex, in September 1976, made application for judicial review for an order quashing by-law 7 and, while the application was pending, checkerboarded its lots.
In November 1975, Homex and the Village negotiated the installation of services along the only street requiring them. By-law 6, enacted in December 1975, provided that it was the policy of the Village that it would neither assume responsibility for a water pipeline constructed by Homex nor permit its connection to the municipal water supply system. Homex coupled an application in judicial review to quash by-law 6 with the application for an order to quash by-law 7.","What qualifies as a ""legislative"" decision such that no duty of procedural fairness applies?",Appeal dismissed.,"Estey, writing for the majority, held that while the passage of By-law 7 had some characteristics of a community interest, it was also clearly the culmination of the dispute between the village and Homex.  As a result he found that the decision was quasi-judicial such as to attract the principle of notice and the doctrine of
audi alteram partem
.  Despite this, however, he held that the conduct of Homex to rid itself of the obligations under the agreement with Atkinson were such that it should be denied a discretionary remedy.  There was also no basis to challenge By-law 6 as it simply stated the facts of the agreement with Atkinson.
Dickson, in the dissent, is quoted:
The courts long ago developed the general proposition that wherever a statute authorizes the interference with property or other rights and is silent as to whether or not the agency in question is required to give notice prior to the intervention in such rights, the courts will ""supply the omission of the legislature"" and require the agency in question to afford the subject an opportunity of being heard before it proceeds.
He held that an act could not be labelled ""legislative"" merely for the purpose of dispensing with fairness. It was not particularly important that the function of the municipality was classified as ""legislative"" or ""quasi-judicial"", rather, it was necessary to look at the nature of the function and to the facts of each case. The by-law in question was not of wide and general application, but was rather aimed at deliberately limiting the rights of Homex, entitling it to some procedural safeguards - at a minimum, notice of the proposed by-law and the opportunity to be heard.","In general, the courts have not imposed procedural requirements on the subordinate law-making function.
The facts of each case are key to determining the level of procedural fairness required."

It found that the board's interpretation, while potentially arguable, was not patently unreasonable or irrational and was within the board's jurisdiction to interpret the agreement.

The court held that Bell did not provide sufficient evidence for their claims and also because they misunderstand impartiality - it does not mean having the freedom to decide a case however one wishes to, being subject to certain binding principles is perfectly legitimate for an impartial judiciary.  Further, the Commission cannot create guidelines that favour them in the Tribunal, because to do so would be

GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,Catholic Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto v CM,"C.M., a child, was born to parents of different religions (father Sikh, mother Roman Catholic). The child was baptized Roman Catholic. The parents separated and had differing views on the child's religious upbringing. The Catholic Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto became involved and sought wardship of the child, requesting an order that the child be raised in the Roman Catholic faith. Lower courts made various orders regarding wardship and religion. The case ultimately reached the Supreme Court of Canada to determine the proper approach to deciding a child's religious upbringing in wardship proceedings when parents disagree or the state intervenes.","What is the proper test for a court to apply when determining the religious upbringing of a child in wardship proceedings under child protection legislation, particularly when parents hold different beliefs or disagree, and how does the child's best interests principle apply?","The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal in part, clarifying the principles governing decisions about a child's religious upbringing in wardship proceedings. The court emphasized that the child's best interests are the paramount consideration.","The court held that the child's best interests, as defined by the relevant provincial child protection legislation, are the governing principle for all decisions concerning the child, including religious upbringing. This principle overrides any conflicting rights or preferences of the parents regarding religion. The court is not bound by parental agreements or past practices regarding religion if they are not in the child's best interests. The court should not make a specific order regarding religious upbringing unless it is demonstrated to be necessary and in the child's best interests, considering factors like the child's background, potential harm from religious conflict or change, and continuity. The court rejected approaches that prioritized parental religious rights or sought to maintain the status quo merely because it existed.","In child protection wardship proceedings, decisions regarding a child's religious upbringing must be based solely on the child's best interests as defined by the applicable child protection legislation, not on parental religious rights or preferences. A specific order concerning a child's religious upbringing should only be made if it is determined to be in the child's best interests.","The aid society took SM into protection on several occasions and supervised her mother, CM, on parenting skills. On consent, SM was made a ward of the society 1989. Throughout the wardship, the society continued to work with CM and facilitated regular visits with SM, however, bonding between mother and daughter remained minimal. In December 1989, after a second four-month wardship, the society brought a status review application seeking an order of Crown wardship without access for the purposes of adoption. CM opposed the motion and the matter was dealt with sporadically throughout 1991. In February 1992 the Ontario Provincial Court ordered that SM be returned to CM on the basis that court intervention was no longer necessary to protect the child. The judge considered CM capable of acquiring the skill to care for her daughter adequately. The society obtained a stay of the order and unsuccessfully appealed to the Ontario Court (General Division). The Court of Appeal granted a stay of the order for return pending appeal and a motion for the introduction of fresh evidence. The new evidence concerned the consistent and repeated assertions of the child that she regarded her foster family as her real family, that she did not want to see her birth mother and that attempts to implement access visits with CM had become almost impossible because of the child's negative reactions - emotional, psychological and physical.  It allowed the appeal, set aside the order for the return of the child to the mother and ordered that the child be made a Crown ward without access for the purposes of adoption. CM appealed to the Supreme Court.",Does the child need continued protection?,Appeal dismissed.,"L'Heureux-Dubé, writing for the court, reviewed the case law and determined that when a court is determining whether the wardship should be terminated or continue, the judge should not determine whether an order of wardship should have been made in the previous or earlier hearings, but instead

The review hearing is not about retrying the original need for a protection order, but rather the court should determine the circumstances of the parents or parent since the last order as it relates to the situation with respect to the child's custody, including their physical, mental and emotional state since that time and also whether there is now a lifestyle, including attitudes of the parent, that warrants the child being returned to the parent or to wardship.
She lays out a two part test:
Does the child continue to need protection and require a court order for protection?
The children's aid society must continue to justify its intervention by showing that a court order is necessary to protect the child in the future.  This does not mean that an absence of proof of a deficiency in the parent's parenting capacity is enough to return the child to the parent.  A court order may be necessary to protect the child from emotional harm which would result in future if the child were taken from its psychological parents.
What is in the best interests of the children?
This should be decided through a balancing of the considerations such as the importance of the continuity of care, the child’s physical/emotional/psychological needs, the benefit of a child's bond to his/her biological parent, as well as psychological bonding of child to his/her foster family.
The furtherance and protection of the child’s best interests must take priority over the desires and interests of the parent.
The question is not merely whether the parent has seen the light and is now prepared to be a good parent, but whether or not the parent has, in factk turned a new leaf and whether he or she is now able to give to the children the care they require?

Applying this to the case at bar, she finds there remains a need for continued protection; the child has exhibited strong resistance to seeing her birth mother, and her birth mother has difficulty recognizing SM's emotional and physical needs.  Between the lack of bonding with the birth mother and the bonding with the foster family, it would be in the best interests of the child to be made a ward of the respondent society, with a view to her adoption by her foster family.",Two stage test for review of a protection order.
GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,Edgeworth Construction Ltd. v N.D. Lea & Associates Ltd.,"Edgeworth Construction Ltd. (contractor) submitted a bid for a road construction project for the Ministry of Transportation and Highways of British Columbia (MOTH). The bid was based on plans and specifications prepared by N.D. Lea & Associates Ltd. (engineering firm), which bore the firm's seal and the engineer's signature. The plans and specifications contained errors and misrepresentations regarding the nature and quantity of work required, leading to increased costs for Edgeworth. Edgeworth sued N.D. Lea & Associates Ltd. for damages resulting from negligent misrepresentation, despite having no direct contract with the engineering firm.","Did the engineering firm, N.D. Lea & Associates Ltd., owe a duty of care to Edgeworth Construction Ltd., a general contractor who relied on the firm's plans and specifications when bidding on and performing a project for a third party (the government), such that the firm could be held liable for negligent misrepresentation?","Yes, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the engineering firm owed a duty of care to the contractor and could be liable for negligent misrepresentation. The appeal was allowed in part, restoring the part of the trial judgment against N.D. Lea & Associates Ltd.","The Court applied the principles of negligent misrepresentation. The engineering firm knew or ought to have known that contractors would rely on the plans and specifications to formulate their bids and carry out the work. By affixing their professional seal and signature to the documents, the firm indicated professional responsibility and that the documents were meant to be relied upon by those, like bidding contractors, who would foreseeably use them. The contractors constituted an identifiable class of persons whose reliance was foreseeable and intended. The absence of a direct contractual relationship between the engineering firm and the contractor did not preclude a duty of care for negligent misrepresentation, which extends beyond contractual privity. The affixing of the seal was equivalent to a representation of the accuracy of the information contained in the documents to potential bidders.","An engineering firm that prepares plans and specifications for a project owner and affixes its professional seal and signature owes a duty of care for negligent misrepresentation to general contractors who foreseeably rely on those documents when bidding on and performing the project, even in the absence of a direct contractual relationship. The professional seal and signature signify responsibility and foreseeable reliance by an identifiable class (bidding contractors).","Edgeworth Construction Ltd. was engaged in the business of building roads in British Columbia.  In 1977, it bid on a contract to build a section of highway in the Revelstoke area.  Its bid was successful, and Edgeworth entered into a contract with the province for the work.  Edgeworth alleges that it lost money on the project due to errors in the specifications and construction drawings.  It commenced proceedings for negligent misrepresentation against the engineering firm which prepared those drawings, N.D. Lea & Associates Ltd. as well as the individual engineers who affixed their seals to the drawings.",Is the defendent exempt from liability due to the intervention of the Ministry and their liability clause?,Appeal allowed.,"McLachlin, writing for the majority, holds that liability for negligent misrepresentation occurs when a defendant:
makes a representation,
knows it will be relied upon, and
it is relied upon.
When Edgeworth performed the construction it was relying on N.D. Lea, not the provincial government.  Following the provisions in
London Drugs
the court finds there was no express or implied protection of the respondent in the contract.  Further, unlike in
London Drugs
the respondent could have drawn up a contract that protected it from liability.","Employees who are not ""powerless"" will not benefit from an employer's exemption."
GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,Miglin v Miglin,"A husband and wife, sophisticated business people, negotiated a comprehensive separation agreement after the breakdown of their marriage. The agreement, drafted with legal advice, dealt with property division, custody, access, child support, and spousal support. A few years later, the wife applied under the Divorce Act for spousal support, arguing the agreement was no longer valid and should be disregarded due to a material change in circumstances. She claimed her business had failed and her financial situation had worsened considerably since the agreement was signed, while the husband's had improved. The trial judge upheld the agreement; the Court of Appeal overturned this decision, finding the agreement should be given little weight due to the changes. The case reached the Supreme Court of Canada.",What is the appropriate approach for courts to take when asked to set aside or vary a spousal support provision in a separation agreement under the Divorce Act? How much weight should be given to a pre-existing agreement?,"The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal, reinstating the trial judge's decision to uphold the agreement, subject to revisiting the child support amount which could impact spousal support.","The Court established a two-stage process for reviewing separation agreements related to spousal support under the Divorce Act. Stage 1 (Formation): Examine the circumstances surrounding the execution of the agreement. Courts should consider whether the agreement was negotiated fairly, with full financial disclosure, legal advice, and free from duress or undue influence. If the formation is flawed, the court may give the agreement little or no weight. The analysis at this stage is prospective, based on the situation at the time of signing. Stage 2 (Review): If the agreement was validly formed, consider whether, at the time of the application to vary, the agreement still reflects the objectives of the Divorce Act (fair compensation, financial self-sufficiency, equitable sharing of consequences of child care). This stage requires a retrospective analysis. A significant change in circumstances alone is not sufficient to overturn a valid agreement; the change must have been unforeseen or unforeseeable at the time of the agreement *and* have led to a situation that is no longer in substantial compliance with the Act's objectives. The agreement is a key factor but not the only one. In this case, the agreement was validly formed. The alleged changes in circumstances, particularly the wife's business failure, were considered risks inherent in her chosen career path and not necessarily unforeseen or rendering the agreement substantially non-compliant with the Act's objectives, given her business background and the nature of the agreement. The Court emphasized promoting the finality and certainty of private ordering through agreements, especially between sophisticated parties who had legal advice.","Separation agreements regarding spousal support are entitled to significant weight and respect under the Divorce Act, reflecting the principle of private ordering. Courts should review such agreements using a two-stage approach: first, examine the circumstances of the agreement's formation (fairness, disclosure, legal advice, absence of coercion); second, if validly formed, consider whether, at the time of the application, the agreement remains in substantial compliance with the objectives of the Divorce Act, taking into account unforeseen or unforeseeable changes in circumstances that have led to a situation that diverges significantly from the Act's goals. A material change in circumstances alone is not sufficient to set aside a valid agreement; the change must be significant and unforeseen/unforeseeable, *and* the agreement must no longer be in substantial compliance with the Act's objectives as a result of that change.","The parties were married for 14 years and had four children. They operated a resort lodge in Algonquin Park in the summer and lived in Toronto in the winter. Both parties worked in the business; the husband handled the finance and the wife the day-to-day operation of the lodge. When they separated in 1993, both parties were in their early 40s and all the children were under 8 years old. The wife wanted to stay home with the children given their ages. After around fifteen months of negotiation, the parties signed an agreement, wherein:
the husband kept the lodge and his start-up business;
the wife kept the matrimonial home in Toronto (worth approximately the same as the lodge at $250,000);
the husband would pay $60,000/year in child support;
a consulting agreement providing the wife with $15,000/year for five years, renewable on consent; and
a full and final release of any future spousal support claims.
After the divorce judgment was issued in 1997, the wife's childcare obligations changed and the consulting agreement was not renewed. She applied to the court for relief, including spousal support. The trial judge referred to the husband as ""manipulative"" and ""obsessive"". The application was allowed, child support was brought in line with the
Guidelines
and the wife was awarded support of $4,400/month for five years. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment regarding spousal support, and the husband was given leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.",When should a support agreement be upheld by the courts?,Appeal allowed; original support order stands.,"Arbour and Bastarache, writing for the majority, stress finality and certainty as key principles in support agreements, citing
s. 9 of the
Divorce Act
; these are contracts and as long as they were entered into openly, the courts should enforce them.
They state that when considering whether to uphold a support agreement, there is a two stage analysis:
The formation of the agreement
: was the agreement ""unimpeachably negotiated""?
Factors to consider:
representation by counsel: the degree of professional assistance received by the party is relevant, but a court should not presume an imbalance of power.
circumstances: was one or both parties vulnerable and if so, did presence of counsel rectify this vulnerability?
duration of negotiations: was the agreement negotiated over a reasonable amount of time?
Substance of the agreement: does the agreement remain in substantial compliance with the objectives of the
Divorce Act
?
The analysis should not be restricted to the spousal support component – look at the whole agreement; the agreement as a whole should substantially comply with the factors and objectives of the
Act
(including the principles of certainty, autonomy and finality).
An agreement can be modified to bring it in line with the principles in the
Act
.
Agreement's correspondence to the parties' original intentions
: were the current circumstances anticipated when the agreement was drafted?
Foreseeability is interpreted broadly; circumstances do not have to have been explicitly considered/contemplated
Foreseeable circumstances include a change of job, assets going down in value, etc.

Generally, where negotiation of the agreement was correct and the agreement remains in substantial compliance with the
Act
, the court should defer to the wishes of the party and accord the agreement great weight.
Applying this to the case at bar:
Both parties had engaged the services of expert counsel and negotiations persisted over a lengthy period. Although the husband may have been the dominant party, the wife had adequate counsel; there was no hint of any vulnerabilities that might not be compensated by counsel.
The quantum of child support established in the agreement intended to provide the wife with a minimum amount of income in contemplation of her not working. While the wife argues that the business generates income, this was accounted for when the assets were valued and divided. The consulting contract reflects the parties' intention to provide the wife with a source of employment income for a limited time. The wife chose not to go back to the workforce, and had substantial assets even without support; there was no hardship or long-term disadvantage.
In the result, the original order should stand.
LeBel and Deschamps, in the dissent, stress very different concepts: interdependence and unequal bargaining power.  They propose a simpler test; is the agreement objectively unfair when considered now?
The dissenters disagree with the majority in two key areas.  One, the presence of counsel may not be enough to negate a power imbalance, and two, that very little deference should be given to agreements that deviate from the objectives in
s. 15.2(6)
of the
Act
; any fair agreement should reasonably realize the four stated objectives.","Establishes the test for enforcement of support agreements.

applies only to final spousal support agreements.  A final agreement is one which limits the amount or duration of support or waives support entirely; it does not contemplate variation."
GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,Dobson v Dobson,"Cynthia Dobson was in a car accident while 27 weeks pregnant with her son, Ryan. Ryan was born prematurely and suffered injuries attributed to the accident. The father, as Ryan's litigation guardian, sued Cynthia for negligence causing Ryan's prenatal injuries.","Does a pregnant woman owe a duty of care in tort to her fetus such that the child, once born alive, can sue the mother for damages resulting from prenatal injuries caused by the mother's negligence during pregnancy?","The Supreme Court of Canada held that a pregnant woman does not owe a duty of care in tort to her fetus. The appeal was allowed, and the action against the mother was dismissed.","The Court reasoned that recognizing such a duty of care would represent an unacceptable intrusion into the pregnant woman's autonomy and bodily integrity. Decisions made by a pregnant woman intimately affect the fetus, and imposing a duty would subject virtually every decision she makes during pregnancy to potential legal scrutiny, creating a massive and unprecedented liability. The Court emphasized that creating this type of duty, which involves significant policy considerations balancing the interests of the born child and the autonomy of the mother, is a matter for the legislature, not the courts.","A pregnant woman does not owe a duty of care in tort to her fetus, and therefore, a child born alive cannot sue its mother in negligence for prenatal injuries caused by the mother's actions or omissions during pregnancy, primarily due to policy concerns regarding maternal autonomy and bodily integrity.","Cynthia Dobson was a pregnant woman.  While in the 27th week of pregnancy she was driving her car when her negligent actions caused a car accident.  The fetus was permanently injured, and was born prematurely that day.  Her son, Ryan Dobson, suffered physical and mental injuries, including cerebral palsy.  His grandfather launched a tort claim for damages against his mother.  Ryan was successful at the Court of Appeal, which his mother appealed.",Should a mother be liable in tort for damages to her child arising from a prenatal negligent act that allegedly injured the fetus in her womb?,Appeal allowed.,"Cory, writing for the majority, finds that the mother should not be held liable in the situation because of the policy implications.  They employ the
Kamloops
test to determine if a duty of care should be owed.  It has two parts:
Is the relationship between the two parties close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there any public policy implications that should negate or limit the scope of the duty?
They find that the first part is satisfied; however the public policy implications negate the duty.  They state that there are two main reasons for this: it would violate the privacy and autonomy of women, and it is impossible to judicially define a reasonable standard of conduct for pregnant women.
McLachlin, in a concurring judgment, states that another main reason why this duty cannot be imposed is that it would violate pregnant women's rights under the
Charter
– specifically liberty and equality.  They would lose their liberty, and not be treated equally with other women in society.
Major, in the dissent, states that in order for the public policy implications to negate the duty they must add new restrictions on what the woman can do.  He says that this is not the case, because she had a duty of care to everyone else on the road, and extending that to the foetus would not change the reasonable standard of her conduct.  He says that this case deals specifically with pregnant women driving automobiles, and if the creation of duty imposed a limitation on her actions that was not there previously then the outcome would be different.  He uses the example with another pregnant woman in the car – if the same outcome occurred, then there is no question that the other woman's foetus could sue her for negligence.  He agrees that the
Kamloops
test applies, but says that the policy implications here do not negate the duty.","Pregnant women do not owe a duty of care to the foetus in their womb.
