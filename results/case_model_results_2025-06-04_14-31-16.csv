The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Nisga'a had a right to occupy their lands and that the Crown's actions in issuing permits and licenses to log and mine the lands were unlawful.","Did the Nisga'a have title to their traditional lands, and if so, had such title been extinguished by the Crown?","The Supreme Court of Canada held that the Nisga'a did have title to their traditional lands, but that such title had been extinguished by the Crown prior to the issuance of permits and licenses to log and mine the lands. However, the Court also held that the Nisga'a had a right to compensation for the loss of their lands.","The Court held that the Nisga'a had title to their traditional lands based on their historical occupation and use of the lands. However, the Court also found that the Crown had extinguished the Nisga'a title through a series of legislative and administrative actions, including the establishment of the Colony of British Columbia and the issuance of permits and licenses to log and mine the lands.","The ratio decidendi of the case is that Indigenous title to traditional lands can be established through historical occupation and use, but that such title can be extinguished by the Crown through clear and plain legislative or administrative action.","The appellants are representative of the Nishga Tribe of British Columbia.  They claim that the aboriginal title over a piece of land in British Columbia that had been present before Confederation had never been extinguished, and that the tribe therefore still had title to the land.  This claim was denied at trial and upheld at appeal.","Do the alleged aboriginal land claims exist?
If the claims exist, were they extinguished?",Appeal dismissed.,"At trial and upon initial appeal the courts decided that if there ever was aboriginal title, it was surely extinguished upon confederation.  The Supreme Court holds that aboriginal title definitely exists, however they were split over whether or not it had been extinguished.  The majority decided that it has been extinguished by virtue of the government's exercise of control over the lands, and therefore the appeal is dismissed.  However, the dissenting judges disagree and state that more must be present to prove that the lands were extinguished.  They say that the provincial government did not have any constitutional right to deal with the land of the aboriginals, and that their predecessors before confederation did not do anything that could amount to extinguishing the lands.","Recognition of aboriginal title.

The court also emphasized the importance of protecting the rights and autonomy of individuals with disabilities.","The court established that non-therapeutic sterilization of a mentally disabled person without their consent is not in their best interests and is a violation of their rights to autonomy, dignity, and bodily integrity.","Eve was a 24 year-old mentally disabled woman living in PEI with a condition that made it very difficult for her to communicate with others.  She was sent away from her mother, who cared for her, during the week so that she could attend a special school.  Her mother was seeking the court's permission to perform a sterilization procedure (hysterectomy) on her daughter.  There was considerable evidence that the daughter would be incapable of handling the burdens of motherhood.  Eve had struck up a friendship with a boy from school, and discussed marriage, and her mother is afraid of the burden that would be placed on Eve, and ultimately upon herself to look after a child if pregnancy ensued.  Permission was denied at trial, but granted at the Court of Appeal.",Can a caregiver for someone incapable of giving informed consent make decisions about surgeries for the incapable individual?,Appeal allowed.,"La Forest, writing for a unanimous court, discusses the history of
parens patriae
jurisdiction, which states that the state is responsible for decisions concerning those that cannot give informed consent themselves. He says that the test is generally that the only procedures that will be allowed are ones that are in the ""best interests"" of the protected person. He focuses his criticism in this case on the fact that Mrs. E. is claiming that the burden on her to look after the child should be considered in making the decision. La Forest states that this should be given no consideration, as it is only the best interests of the protected person that are of concern.
He also says that arguing about the protected person's fitness as a parents involves value-loaded questions that result in a designation of disabled persons as less competent parents, even though there is significant evidence showing that they show as much fondness and concern for their children as anyone else. He also considers that the procedure of a hysterectomy is serious surgery and quite invasive, and further that Eve does not require assistance caring for her reproductive cycle, which is a concern in other cases. Perhaps most importantly, this surgery is not therapeutic.
La Forest concludes that ""the grave intrusion on a person’s rights and the certain physical damage that ensues from non-therapeutic sterilization without consent, when compared to the highly questionable advantages that can result, [show that] it can never safely be determined that such a procedure is for the benefit of the person."" The procedure should never be authorized for non-therapeutic purposes under the
parens patriae
jurisdiction.","Non-therapeutic surgeries can never be determined to be for the benefit of a person who is incapable of giving informed consent.
It is only the best interests of the disabled person concerned that are of importance; concerns of others should not be considered."

He filed a complaint with the Council of Human Rights alleging discrimination based on his disability.,Whether the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles' decision to deny Grismer a driver's license constituted discrimination under the Human Rights Code.,The court held that the Superintendent's decision was discriminatory and that Grismer's rights under the Human Rights Code had been infringed.,The court found that the Superintendent had not established that the visual standards for obtaining a driver's license were a bona fide occupational requirement. The court also found that the Superintendent had not provided sufficient evidence to justify the denial of Grismer's license application.,The decision established that a service provider must provide reasonable accommodation to individuals with disabilities unless it can be shown that doing so would cause undue hardship.,"The Government of British Columbia had a policy stating that it would not issue licenses to people suffering from a condition (homonymous hemianopsia (HH)) which affected eyesight.  The claimant had this condition but had driven flawlessly at work and on public roads using ""prism glasses"".  Despite this he was refused individual assessment and was not allowed to receive a license and was therefore unable to complete his job.  The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal allowed Grismer to be individually tested.  Grismer died shortly after this decision.  This was upheld by the British Columbia Supreme Court but overruled by the Court of Appeal.",Does an absolute prohibition on licensing people with a visual impairment without the possibility of individual assessment constitute discrimination?,"Appeal allowed, standard disallowed.","The court applies the
Meiorin
test, showing that it can be used in scenarios outside of the workplace to determine if discrimination is justified.  This case passes the first part because the purpose of the standard (reasonable safety) is rationally connected to the function (issuing drivers’ licenses).  It also passes the second step because there is no evidence that the standard (no licenses for HH sufferers) was adopted for any reasons other than road safety.  However the case fails the third step as the court finds that the standard (no licenses for HH) is not reasonably necessary for the purpose (reasonable safety).  The blanket prohibition doesn't let people even attempt to show that they can drive safely.
It is clear here that the accommodation would be to allow testing.  In order to succeed the government would have had to prove that to allow testing would result to undue hardship which they failed to do.  Although there are clearly safety and cost concerns involved with testing, the government didn't put in any effort to determine these values, nor did they even look for alternative ways of testing.  The court also says that in general, with the government, costs must be exorbitant to amount to undue hardship, as they are publicly funded and this would be seen as being in the public interest.  As the standard is not rationally necessary for the purpose of reasonable road safety, it amounts to discrimination and must be removed.","The
Meiorin
test applies to all standards that are thought to be discriminatory, even if they do not occur in a workplace; called bona fide justification tests.
The government will be held to a very high threshold when claiming that the costs of not adopting a standard amount to undue hardship as they are publicly funded and preventing discrimination is in the public interest."

His employment contract included a clause that limited his entitlement to notice of termination to the minimum required by the Employment Standards Act (ESA). When Machtinger was terminated, he received the minimum notice required by the ESA, but he claimed that he was entitled to reasonable notice at common law.","Was the termination clause in Machtinger's employment contract enforceable, or was he entitled to reasonable notice at common law?","The Supreme Court of Canada held that the termination clause was not enforceable, and Machtinger was entitled to reasonable notice at common law.","The court found that the termination clause was ambiguous and did not clearly exclude Machtinger's entitlement to reasonable notice at common law. The court also held that the ESA was intended to provide a minimum standard for employment contracts, and that employers could not contract out of the requirement to provide reasonable notice.","An employment contract must clearly and unambiguously exclude an employee's entitlement to reasonable notice at common law in order to be enforceable. If the contract is ambiguous, the employee will be entitled to reasonable notice at common law.","Both appellants began working for HOJ Industries, a car dealer, in 1978, and were discharged in 1985 without cause.  At the time they were dismissed Machtinger was credit manager and rust‑proofing sales manager and Lefebvre was sales manager.  Each had entered into a contract for employment for an indefinite period which contained a clause allowing the respondent to terminate his employment without cause, in Machtinger's case without notice and in Lefebvre's case on two weeks' notice.  Under the provincial
Employment Standards Act
the appellants were entitled to a minimum notice period of four weeks.  After they were dismissed, the respondent paid each of them the equivalent of four weeks' salary.  The appellants brought action for wrongful dismissal and the trial judge found that they were entitled to reasonable notice of termination, and that the period of reasonable notice for Machtinger was 7 months and for Lefebvre, 7½ months, however this was overturned by the Court of Appeal.",What should the notice period be in order to terminate employment if notice required in employment contract violates legislated standards?,"Appeal allowed, lower court judgment restored.","McLachlin, writing a concurring judgment, examined the legal principles governing the implication of terms.

She finds that the Court of Appeal erred in characterizing a term implied in law as a term implied in fact, which brought in the intentionality of the parties.

On consent, SM was made a ward of the society 1989. Throughout the wardship, the society continued to work with CM and facilitated regular visits with SM, however, bonding between mother and daughter remained minimal. In December 1989, after a second four-month wardship, the society brought a status review application seeking an order of Crown wardship without access for the purposes of adoption. CM opposed the motion and the matter was dealt with sporadically throughout 1991. In February 1992 the Ontario Provincial Court ordered that SM be returned to CM on the basis that court intervention was no longer necessary to protect the child. The judge considered CM capable of acquiring the skill to care for her daughter adequately. The society obtained a stay of the order and unsuccessfully appealed to the Ontario Court (General Division). The Court of Appeal granted a stay of the order for return pending appeal and a motion for the introduction of fresh evidence. The new evidence concerned the consistent and repeated assertions of the child that she regarded her foster family as her real family, that she did not want to see her birth mother and that attempts to implement access visits with CM had become almost impossible because of the child's negative reactions - emotional, psychological and physical.  It allowed the appeal, set aside the order for the return of the child to the mother and ordered that the child be made a Crown ward without access for the purposes of adoption. CM appealed to the Supreme Court.",Does the child need continued protection?,Appeal dismissed.,"L'Heureux-Dubé, writing for the court, reviewed the case law and determined that when a court is determining whether the wardship should be terminated or continue, the judge should not determine whether an order of wardship should have been made in the previous or earlier hearings, but instead
now
consider whether continuation of the wardship in the current proceedings is in the best interests of the child without overlooking the parents' rights.  The review hearing is not about retrying the original need for a protection order, but rather the court should determine the circumstances of the parents or parent since the last order as it relates to the situation with respect to the child's custody, including their physical, mental and emotional state since that time and also whether there is now a lifestyle, including attitudes of the parent, that warrants the child being returned to the parent or to wardship.
She lays out a two part test:
Does the child continue to need protection and require a court order for protection?
The children's aid society must continue to justify its intervention by showing that a court order is necessary to protect the child in the future.  This does not mean that an absence of proof of a deficiency in the parent's parenting capacity is enough to return the child to the parent.  A court order may be necessary to protect the child from emotional harm which would result in future if the child were taken from its psychological parents.
What is in the best interests of the children?
This should be decided through a balancing of the considerations such as the importance of the continuity of care, the child’s physical/emotional/psychological needs, the benefit of a child's bond to his/her biological parent, as well as psychological bonding of child to his/her foster family.
The furtherance and protection of the child’s best interests must take priority over the desires and interests of the parent.
The question is not merely whether the parent has seen the light and is now prepared to be a good parent, but whether or not the parent has, in factk turned a new leaf and whether he or she is now able to give to the children the care they require?

: was the agreement ""unimpeachably negotiated""?

duration of negotiations: was the agreement negotiated over a reasonable amount of time?

Generally, where negotiation of the agreement was correct and the agreement remains in substantial compliance with the
Act
, the court should defer to the wishes of the party and accord the agreement great weight.
Applying this to the case at bar:
Both parties had engaged the services of expert counsel and negotiations persisted over a lengthy period. Although the husband may have been the dominant party, the wife had adequate counsel; there was no hint of any vulnerabilities that might not be compensated by counsel.
The quantum of child support established in the agreement intended to provide the wife with a minimum amount of income in contemplation of her not working. While the wife argues that the business generates income, this was accounted for when the assets were valued and divided. The consulting contract reflects the parties' intention to provide the wife with a source of employment income for a limited time. The wife chose not to go back to the workforce, and had substantial assets even without support; there was no hardship or long-term disadvantage.
In the result, the original order should stand.
LeBel and Deschamps, in the dissent, stress very different concepts: interdependence and unequal bargaining power.  They propose a simpler test; is the agreement objectively unfair when considered now?
The dissenters disagree with the majority in two key areas.  One, the presence of counsel may not be enough to negate a power imbalance, and two, that very little deference should be given to agreements that deviate from the objectives in
s. 15.2(6)

They employ the
Kamloops
test to determine if a duty of care should be owed.  It has two parts:
Is the relationship between the two parties close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there any public policy implications that should negate or limit the scope of the duty?
They find that the first part is satisfied; however the public policy implications negate the duty.  They state that there are two main reasons for this: it would violate the privacy and autonomy of women, and it is impossible to judicially define a reasonable standard of conduct for pregnant women.
McLachlin, in a concurring judgment, states that another main reason why this duty cannot be imposed is that it would violate pregnant women's rights under the
Charter
– specifically liberty and equality.  They would lose their liberty, and not be treated equally with other women in society.
Major, in the dissent, states that in order for the public policy implications to negate the duty they must add new restrictions on what the woman can do.  He says that this is not the case, because she had a duty of care to everyone else on the road, and extending that to the foetus would not change the reasonable standard of her conduct.  He says that this case deals specifically with pregnant women driving automobiles, and if the creation of duty imposed a limitation on her actions that was not there previously then the outcome would be different.  He uses the example with another pregnant woman in the car – if the same outcome occurred, then there is no question that the other woman's foetus could sue her for negligence.  He agrees that the

OPENAI.gpt-4o,Calder et al. v British Columbia (Attorney General),"The case involved a challenge to the constitutionality of a British Columbia law requiring mandatory arbitration of disputes arising from construction projects.  The plaintiffs, representing various construction industry groups, argued that the mandatory arbitration scheme violated their right to a fair trial under section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.","Does the mandatory arbitration scheme, as applied to construction projects in British Columbia, violate the right to a fair trial under section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms?",The court held that the mandatory arbitration scheme did not violate section 7 of the Charter.,"The court considered the nature and scope of the right to a fair trial, including the procedural safeguards it entails.  It analyzed the mandatory arbitration scheme, noting the procedural protections inherent within it, like the right to legal representation and the ability to appeal certain decisions. The court concluded that while the scheme substituted a private process for a court trial, this did not automatically render the process unfair.  It assessed the specifics of the scheme, finding it did not violate the essential elements of a fair trial.","A mandatory arbitration scheme, even if it replaces a court trial, does not automatically violate the right to a fair trial under section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms if it provides comparable procedural safeguards and does not fundamentally alter the essential elements of fairness, such as the right to legal representation.","The appellants are representative of the Nishga Tribe of British Columbia.  They claim that the aboriginal title over a piece of land in British Columbia that had been present before Confederation had never been extinguished, and that the tribe therefore still had title to the land.  This claim was denied at trial and upheld at appeal.","Do the alleged aboriginal land claims exist?

The Supreme Court holds that aboriginal title definitely exists, however they were split over whether or not it had been extinguished.  The majority decided that it has been extinguished by virtue of the government's exercise of control over the lands, and therefore the appeal is dismissed.  However, the dissenting judges disagree and state that more must be present to prove that the lands were extinguished.  They say that the provincial government did not have any constitutional right to deal with the land of the aboriginals, and that their predecessors before confederation did not do anything that could amount to extinguishing the lands.","Recognition of aboriginal title.

She was sent away from her mother, who cared for her, during the week so that she could attend a special school.  Her mother was seeking the court's permission to perform a sterilization procedure (hysterectomy) on her daughter.  There was considerable evidence that the daughter would be incapable of handling the burdens of motherhood.  Eve had struck up a friendship with a boy from school, and discussed marriage, and her mother is afraid of the burden that would be placed on Eve, and ultimately upon herself to look after a child if pregnancy ensued.  Permission was denied at trial, but granted at the Court of Appeal.",Can a caregiver for someone incapable of giving informed consent make decisions about surgeries for the incapable individual?,Appeal allowed.,"La Forest, writing for a unanimous court, discusses the history of
parens patriae
jurisdiction, which states that the state is responsible for decisions concerning those that cannot give informed consent themselves. He says that the test is generally that the only procedures that will be allowed are ones that are in the ""best interests"" of the protected person. He focuses his criticism in this case on the fact that Mrs. E. is claiming that the burden on her to look after the child should be considered in making the decision. La Forest states that this should be given no consideration, as it is only the best interests of the protected person that are of concern.
He also says that arguing about the protected person's fitness as a parents involves value-loaded questions that result in a designation of disabled persons as less competent parents, even though there is significant evidence showing that they show as much fondness and concern for their children as anyone else. He also considers that the procedure of a hysterectomy is serious surgery and quite invasive, and further that Eve does not require assistance caring for her reproductive cycle, which is a concern in other cases. Perhaps most importantly, this surgery is not therapeutic.
La Forest concludes that ""the grave intrusion on a person’s rights and the certain physical damage that ensues from non-therapeutic sterilization without consent, when compared to the highly questionable advantages that can result, [show that] it can never safely be determined that such a procedure is for the benefit of the person."" The procedure should never be authorized for non-therapeutic purposes under the

OPENAI.gpt-4o,British Columbia v British Columbia Government Service Employees' Union (Re Meiorin),"The British Columbia government, through the British Columbia Public Service Agency, had a policy requiring its employees to pass a physical ability test (PAT) as a prerequisite for certain job positions.  The test was more demanding than required to perform the actual job duties.

The British Columbia Government Employees' Union (B.C.G.E.U.) challenged the policy, arguing that it discriminated against women, who, on average, scored lower on the PAT than men.","Did the physical ability test (PAT) imposed by the British Columbia government violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, specifically section 15(1) prohibiting discrimination based on sex?",The Supreme Court of Canada held that the PAT was discriminatory and violated section 15(1) of the Charter.,"The Court reasoned that while the PAT might have been designed with a neutral aim (safety and fitness), it was demonstrably disproportionately challenging to women and thus could not be justified as a demonstrably valid or reasonable requirement for the positions in question.  The government failed to demonstrate a bona fide occupational requirement and a less discriminatory alternative.","A discriminatory practice, even if ostensibly neutral, is prohibited under section 15(1) of the Canadian Charter unless the government can demonstrate a demonstrably valid and reasonable requirement for the employment position.

The father had sole interim custody after separation but then the parties entered into an informal shared custody arrangement where neither party paid support.  Three years later the mother brought an action in Alberta for retroactive and ongoing support.  The chambers judge awarded her prospective support but not retroactive.  The Court of Appeal allowed her appeal, but found no blameworthy conduct or willful failure to disclose on the part of the father.
Three children were born in the course of a common law relationship. After separation the children lived with the mother, and some months later the father paid $150 in child support pursuant to a maintenance agreement which was increased to $300/month following a consent order.  The mother brought an action for retroactive support.  The father had low income and high access costs and resisted the action.  The chambers judge held retroactive support would constitute hardship.
Parents married in 1984 and divorced in 1991. After separation the two children lived with their mother and a divorce judgment ordered the father to pay $700/month in child support.  In 2000 the mother signaled an intention to request increased support.  The father voluntarily increased his payments, but still below the table amount.  The mother was unaware that his income had increased dramatically as they lived in different cities.  At chambers, the judge granted her application for retroactive support based on the table amount, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal in a 2-1 judgment.
Parents divorced in 1996.  The children lived with the father, then one of the children moved to lived with the mother.  The father had a lot more income and the mother asked for an increase of support but the father rejected the request.  The mother was hesitant to take the case to court because earlier proceedings had caused a rift between the mother and children.  The chambers judge held that this was an appropriate circumstance for a retroactive award, and he calculated it from January 1, 2003 onward, to be paid in the amount of $500/month, as a ""reasonable compromise"" that best fit the situation of the parties.  The Court of Appeal upheld the decision.

should be allowed and the decisions of the chambers judges restored.  The appeals in
Henry

should be dismissed.","Justice Bastarache, writing for the majority, held that children are entitled to child support from both parents commensurate with their income.  To prevent liability for retroactive support, any changes in income should be reported to the custodial parent.  If this is not done and an application is brought to enforce a change, four factors should be analysed to see if retroactive support is warranted:
Undue delay: does the recipient have a reasonable excuse for not seeking support earlier?
Any voluntary, intentional choice not to apply for an increase will militate against retroactive support.  There is a balancing here; a child should not be punished for a poor choice of the parent.
Was there blameworthy conduct on the part of the payor?
This is interpreted broadly; anything that privileges the payor's interests over his/her children's right to an appropriate amount of support.
Could the payor have reasonably believed that they were discharging their support obligations?
The more significant a change in income, the more likely a court will find a payor's behaviour blameworthy if they do not proactively disclose.
Need of child/benefit: would the child benefit from retroactive award based on their needs/circumstances?
If a child's needs are being met by the current support, this will militate against a retroactive award.
Would a retroactive award cause hardship to payor?
This is a distinct element from the
s. 10
undue hardship test.
Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.

Turning to how far back retroactive payments should go, it turns on the conduct of the parents.  If there was no blameworthy behaviour, the retroactivity should go to when the custodial parent informs the payor that they are seeking additional support.  Generally there will be a limit of 3 years.  For blameworthy parents, the retroactivity should continue to when the support should have changed and did not, without limit.
As to the amount of a retroactive payment, the court should follow the
Guidelines
, but the court has broad discretion to craft a remedy that would be fair having regard to all the circumstances, including hardship on the payor.
Applying this to the cases...
This was an initial application for child support.  The parents had a shared custody arrangement that thought that meant no child support was payable (see
Contino v Leonelli-Contino
).  The incomes of the parents were relatively equal and due to the shared custody any money going to one household would simply be removed from the other.  Due to the lack of blameworthy conduct and the lack of benefit to the children, no retroactive support was awarded.
The father from whom support was being sought was low income (~$23,000/year) and he was supporting a second family.  Any retroactive award would cause his household hardship.  The access costs for him were also high.  Because of the lack of blameworthy conduct, the hardship a retroactive award would cause, and the fact that the standard of living in the custodial household was higher, no retroactive support was awarded.
In this case, the mother had broached the subject with the father but could not afford a lawyer to fight the case.  She was intimidated by her ex-husband and did not know much about his financial situation as he lived in another city.  The husband had had a huge income increase and held it from her, as well as saying that she should have managed her money better to better provide for their kids and that he was paying all he could afford.  Due to the large amount of blameworthy conduct and the large discrepancy in the amount he was paying and the table amount, the court awarded $100,000 in retroactive support.
As in
Henry
, the parties had very different incomes; the father earned more than $100,000K/year, much more than the mother, and he gave no financial support when the need arose.  The mother said she had not wanted to litigate because of the effect it had had on her daughter the last time they litigated.  The court held that the delay of mother was not unreasonable, and the father had no reasonable grounds on which to believe the level of support he was paying was reasonable, and thus the award granted at trial was upheld.
Abella, dissenting in part, had three issues with the decision of Bastarache.
The presumptive starting date of effective notice: the payor has the information on when their income changes, so it is impractical and unrealistic to expect the recipient to keep tabs on the payor’s income; the date should be when the income changes.
The role of blameworthy conduct: the conduct of the payor should be immaterial; the whole obligation depends on the income increase, conduct of the parties is irrelevant.
The three year cutoff: Abella finds this arbitrary - any cutoff of this type should be found in statute, not created by the courts.","Retroactive child support orders should no longer be rare or difficult to obtain.
Established the framework for assessing claims where there is a large, undisclosed swing in income.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?

This case is sometimes referred to as the ""don't-ask-don't-tell"" case, as the

Highway Traffic Act
(now
s. 188
) which prohibited driving ""on a highway without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway"". The defendant challenged the law, claiming that it was beyond the power of the province because the federal government had ""occupied the field"" with a similar criminal provision in ss. 191/221 (now
s. 219
) of the
Criminal Code
, which prohibited driving with ""wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons"".  O'Grady was convicted at trial and an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba was dismissed.","Are provincial laws relating to negligence with penal consequences criminal law and therefore
ultra vires
the province?",Appeal dismissed.,"Judson, writing for the majority, held that ""the power of a provincial legislature to enact legislation for the regulation of highway traffic is undoubted"".  He reaffirmed the principle that there exists a ""general area"" or ""domain"" of criminal law and the two governments can make law on the same matter by creating a distinction between the types of culpability.  He quotes from Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law:
There are only two states of mind which constitute
mens rea
, and they are intention and recklessness. The difference between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; they are opposed and it is a logical fallacy to suggest that recklessness is a degree of negligence. The common habit of lawyers to qualify the word ""negligence"" with some moral epithet such as ""wicked"", ""gross"", or ""culpable"" has been most unfortunate since it has inevitably led to great confusion of thought and of principle. It is equally misleading to speak of criminal negligence since this is merely to use an expression to explain itself.
On the facts, Judson found that there was overlap between the laws however ""there is no conflict between these provisions in the sense that they are repugnant"". The provincial law extended to include ""inadvertent negligence"" as well as regular negligence. It was enough that “the two pieces of legislation differed both in legislative purpose and legal and practical effect” to justify both of them.","The distinction between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; recklessness is when an actor does not desire harmful consequences but forsees the possibility and consciously takes the risk.
There must be an operational incompatibility between federal and provincial law to invoke paramountcy."

He makes a claim to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, but refuses to argue sexual orientation as a ground, and instead will only argue family status, stating that all matters to do with homosexuals are not about sexual orientation by definition.  The case was dismissed in the lower courts.","Can a homosexual man claim discrimination against ""family status"" with his partner under

However, Mossop sticks with family status.  The majority says that you cannot interpret ""family status"" to include Mossop’s situation unless you also discuss the ground of sexual orientation, and as Mossop refuses to do so he cannot be successful.
La Forest
concurs, but instead looks to the definitions in the Act and tries to figure out what the government meant to protect under ""family status"".  He determines that this specific field was not intended to be covered.
In the dissent,
L'Heureux-Dubé
says that ""family status"" should have a very broad interpretation.  She looks to the broader social context of limiting it as the majority does, and further that by looking at the plain meaning given in the statute you are really just taking the majority's opinion of the definition, which is exactly what you try to avoid in human rights issues.  She also suggests that when there are overlapping grounds, you should select the one that will succeed and proceed with that one.","Only identified grounds can be pursued in a human rights claim.

OPENAI.gpt-4o,British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v British Columbia (Council of Human Rights) (Re Grismer Estate),"The estate of a deceased driver, Mr. Grismer, was appealing a decision by the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles to suspend his driver's licence. The suspension was based on Mr. Grismer's refusal to provide a blood sample to determine if he was impaired, arguing this violated his right against self-incrimination under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Council of Human Rights upheld the right to refuse blood alcohol tests, asserting a conflict between the driver's rights and the provincial government's enforcement measures.  The case centered around the legal limits and constitutional implications of the requirement for blood tests in impaired driving cases.  ",Whether the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles' practice of suspending a driver's licence for refusing to provide a blood sample to determine blood alcohol content violated the driver's right against self-incrimination under section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms?,The appeal was allowed. The suspension of Mr. Grismer's licence was deemed unlawful.,"The Supreme Court of Canada held that while the provincial government had a legitimate interest in enforcing impaired driving laws, the mandatory blood alcohol test requirement infringed upon the individual's right against self-incrimination. The Court emphasized that the driver's refusal should not be used as a basis for suspension unless there was substantial evidence of impairment. The Court also weighed the potential impact of such mandatory testing against the fundamental right to freedom from self-incrimination.  The Court determined the existing evidence for impairment wasn't sufficient to justify suspension on the basis of the refusal alone.","The mandatory blood alcohol test, in the absence of other compelling evidence of impairment, is an infringement on the Charter right to freedom from self-incrimination.  A driver's refusal to provide a blood sample, by itself, cannot justify a licence suspension. This decision established that in such cases, the evidentiary threshold for suspension on the basis of a refusal to provide a sample must be substantially higher than simply the refusal itself.","The Government of British Columbia had a policy stating that it would not issue licenses to people suffering from a condition (homonymous hemianopsia (HH)) which affected eyesight.  The claimant had this condition but had driven flawlessly at work and on public roads using ""prism glasses"".  Despite this he was refused individual assessment and was not allowed to receive a license and was therefore unable to complete his job.  The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal allowed Grismer to be individually tested.  Grismer died shortly after this decision.  This was upheld by the British Columbia Supreme Court but overruled by the Court of Appeal.",Does an absolute prohibition on licensing people with a visual impairment without the possibility of individual assessment constitute discrimination?,"Appeal allowed, standard disallowed.","The court applies the
Meiorin
test, showing that it can be used in scenarios outside of the workplace to determine if discrimination is justified.  This case passes the first part because the purpose of the standard (reasonable safety) is rationally connected to the function (issuing drivers’ licenses).  It also passes the second step because there is no evidence that the standard (no licenses for HH sufferers) was adopted for any reasons other than road safety.  However the case fails the third step as the court finds that the standard (no licenses for HH) is not reasonably necessary for the purpose (reasonable safety).  The blanket prohibition doesn't let people even attempt to show that they can drive safely.
It is clear here that the accommodation would be to allow testing.  In order to succeed the government would have had to prove that to allow testing would result to undue hardship which they failed to do.  Although there are clearly safety and cost concerns involved with testing, the government didn't put in any effort to determine these values, nor did they even look for alternative ways of testing.  The court also says that in general, with the government, costs must be exorbitant to amount to undue hardship, as they are publicly funded and this would be seen as being in the public interest.  As the standard is not rationally necessary for the purpose of reasonable road safety, it amounts to discrimination and must be removed.","The
Meiorin
test applies to all standards that are thought to be discriminatory, even if they do not occur in a workplace; called bona fide justification tests.
The government will be held to a very high threshold when claiming that the costs of not adopting a standard amount to undue hardship as they are publicly funded and preventing discrimination is in the public interest."
OPENAI.gpt-4o,Just v British Columbia,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,"Heavy snow fall forced Just and his daughter to stop in a line of traffic by a rocky slope on a major highway.  A boulder, which worked loose from the wooded slopes above the highway, came crashing down on the appellant's car, killing the appellant's daughter and causing him very serious injuries.  Just brought an action against the provincial government contending that the government negligently failed to properly maintain the highway.
The Department of Highways had set up a system for inspection and remedial work upon rock slopes.  Inspection and recommendations were made by engineers and the work was effected by a rock scaling crew responsible for performing remedial work throughout the entire province.  The department's practice had been to make visual inspections from the highway unless rock falls or a history of instability in an area indicated a need for the rock engineer to climb the slope.  Numerous informal inspections were carried out by highway personnel as they drove along the road.
The trial judge found that the entire system of inspection and the way it was implemented was a policy matter which did not give rise to liability. No finding was made as to whether or not the system of inspection was reasonable or whether the inspections themselves were properly carried out. The Court of Appeal upheld the finding of the trial judge and Just appealled to the Supreme Court.","Is the government under a duty of care to maintain the highways and if so, are they liable if the highways are not sufficiently maintained?","Appeal allowed, new trial ordered.","Cory, writing for the majority, held that the province owes a duty of care, which ordinarily extends to their reasonable maintenance, to those using its highways.  The Department of Highways could readily foresee the risk that harm might befall users of a highway if it were not reasonably maintained.  That maintenance could be found to extend to the prevention of injury from falling rock.
Government agencies may be exempt from the application of the traditional tort law duty of care if an explicit statutory exemption exists or if the decision arose as a result of a policy decision.  Whether or not a decision is characterized as a policy decision or as an operational decision rests on the nature of the decision and not on the identity of the actors.  Generally, decisions concerning budgetary allotments for departments or government agencies should be classified as policy decisions.  A policy decision may be open to challenge on the basis that it is not made in the bona fide exercise of discretion.  If after due consideration it is found that a duty of care is owed by the government agency and no exemption by way of statute or policy decision-making is found to exist, a traditional torts analysis ensues (as per
Anns v Merton London Borough Council
) and the issue of standard of care required of the government agency must next be considered.  The manner and quality of an inspection system, since it was clearly part of the operational aspect of a governmental activity, should be assessed when consideration is given to the standard of care issue.  At this stage, the requisite standard of care must be assessed in light of all the surrounding circumstances including budgetary restraints and the availability of qualified personnel and equipment.
Sopinka, in the dissent, held that the government had the power to carry out the inspections but was under no duty to do so.  Conduct within the limits of this discretion gives rise to no duty of care; conduct outside of these limits may attract a private law duty of care.
A litigant may not attack a policy and it is not appropriate for a Court to pass on it, absent evidence that a policy was adopted for some ulterior motive and not for a municipal purpose.  In order for a private duty to arise, it would have to be shown that the Rockwork Section acted outside its delegated discretion to determine whether to inspect and the manner in which the inspection is to be made.  Policy decisions are immune from review because they usually entail not only a decision to do something but also some call upon the public purse.  The government was acting within its discretion when it decided that inspections should be done and the manner in which they were to be done.  Responsibility for deciding the extent to which the inspection program was to be implemented was delegated to the Rockwork Section.","The duty of care should apply to a public authority unless there is a valid basis for its exclusion.
Policy decisions – the decision by the government about what acts to perform under a given statute – are exempt from liability; operational decisions – the decision by the government about how to perform those acts once they have been decided - are not exempt from liability."

The employer did not give him the chance to defend himself against the accusations. This was viewed as a violation of the principle of natural justice.  The employer's actions were considered arbitrary and did not adhere to reasonable standards of conduct.,"Employers have a duty to provide reasonable procedural fairness to employees when considering termination. This includes providing notice of the allegations, an opportunity to respond, and a chance to present evidence in defense.","Both appellants began working for HOJ Industries, a car dealer, in 1978, and were discharged in 1985 without cause.  At the time they were dismissed Machtinger was credit manager and rust‑proofing sales manager and Lefebvre was sales manager.

Under the provincial
Employment Standards Act
the appellants were entitled to a minimum notice period of four weeks.  After they were dismissed, the respondent paid each of them the equivalent of four weeks' salary.  The appellants brought action for wrongful dismissal and the trial judge found that they were entitled to reasonable notice of termination, and that the period of reasonable notice for Machtinger was 7 months and for Lefebvre, 7½ months, however this was overturned by the Court of Appeal.",What should the notice period be in order to terminate employment if notice required in employment contract violates legislated standards?,"Appeal allowed, lower court judgment restored.","McLachlin, writing a concurring judgment, examined the legal principles governing the implication of terms.

).
She finds that the Court of Appeal erred in characterizing a term implied in law as a term implied in fact, which brought in the intentionality of the parties.  Holding that the employer had a legal obligation to provide reasonable notice and that this can only be displaced by an express contrary agreement, the court imposed a reasonable term of notification on HOJ; HOJ industries.","Terms can be implied by the court based on:

OPENAI.gpt-4o,Homex Realty and Development Co. Ltd. v Wyoming (Village),I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,"As a condition of registration of a plan of subdivision in the Village of Wyoming, Atkinson, the owner and subdivider of the parcel of land, entered into an agreement with the Village for the installation of municipal services in the subdivision. This agreement, dated January 22, 1968, and registered September 26, 1975, provided in a general way for the owner's providing ""all the requirements financial and otherwise, of the Corporation re surfacing of roads, installation of services and drainage"". The agreement also prevented the sale of the lands in question until the agreement had been fully carried out, except with the consent of the Village, but the provision did not provide that consent would operate to release Atkinson from his obligation to the Village. Before any services were installed, Homex bought the great majority of the lots on the subdivision with the Village's consent. There was some question as to whether or not Homex had undertaken to assume the obligations of the original subdivider. Nevertheless, when protracted negotiations between the Village and Homex concerning the installation of services proved fruitless, the Village, in April 1976, pursuant to s. 29(3) (now
s. 50(3)
) of the
Planning Act
and without notice to Homex, enacted by-law 7 deeming the lots purchased by Homex not to be a registered plan of subdivision. Homex, in September 1976, made application for judicial review for an order quashing by-law 7 and, while the application was pending, checkerboarded its lots.
In November 1975, Homex and the Village negotiated the installation of services along the only street requiring them. By-law 6, enacted in December 1975, provided that it was the policy of the Village that it would neither assume responsibility for a water pipeline constructed by Homex nor permit its connection to the municipal water supply system. Homex coupled an application in judicial review to quash by-law 6 with the application for an order to quash by-law 7.","What qualifies as a ""legislative"" decision such that no duty of procedural fairness applies?",Appeal dismissed.,"Estey, writing for the majority, held that while the passage of By-law 7 had some characteristics of a community interest, it was also clearly the culmination of the dispute between the village and Homex.  As a result he found that the decision was quasi-judicial such as to attract the principle of notice and the doctrine of
audi alteram partem
.  Despite this, however, he held that the conduct of Homex to rid itself of the obligations under the agreement with Atkinson were such that it should be denied a discretionary remedy.  There was also no basis to challenge By-law 6 as it simply stated the facts of the agreement with Atkinson.
Dickson, in the dissent, is quoted:
The courts long ago developed the general proposition that wherever a statute authorizes the interference with property or other rights and is silent as to whether or not the agency in question is required to give notice prior to the intervention in such rights, the courts will ""supply the omission of the legislature"" and require the agency in question to afford the subject an opportunity of being heard before it proceeds.
He held that an act could not be labelled ""legislative"" merely for the purpose of dispensing with fairness. It was not particularly important that the function of the municipality was classified as ""legislative"" or ""quasi-judicial"", rather, it was necessary to look at the nature of the function and to the facts of each case. The by-law in question was not of wide and general application, but was rather aimed at deliberately limiting the rights of Homex, entitling it to some procedural safeguards - at a minimum, notice of the proposed by-law and the opportunity to be heard.","In general, the courts have not imposed procedural requirements on the subordinate law-making function.
The facts of each case are key to determining the level of procedural fairness required."

The CTEA sought to include a clause requiring Bell to offer employees a choice between a new pension plan or a continuation of the old one.  Bell refused, arguing this was a managerial prerogative.  The dispute went to arbitration.",Did the arbitrator exceed their authority in ordering Bell to offer employees a choice between pension plans?,The decision of the arbitrator was upheld by the court.,The arbitrator's decision was based on the interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement and the specific circumstances of the dispute. The arbitrator considered that the employees had a legitimate interest in the pension issue and that Bell's refusal to offer a choice was not justified.,"Arbitrators have the authority to interpret collective bargaining agreements and make decisions on disputes arising from them, provided their decisions are not arbitrary or capricious and are supported by the language and context of the agreement.

Further, the Commission cannot create guidelines that favour them in the Tribunal, because to do so would be

OPENAI.gpt-4o,Catholic Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto v CM,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,"The aid society took SM into protection on several occasions and supervised her mother, CM, on parenting skills. On consent, SM was made a ward of the society 1989. Throughout the wardship, the society continued to work with CM and facilitated regular visits with SM, however, bonding between mother and daughter remained minimal. In December 1989, after a second four-month wardship, the society brought a status review application seeking an order of Crown wardship without access for the purposes of adoption. CM opposed the motion and the matter was dealt with sporadically throughout 1991. In February 1992 the Ontario Provincial Court ordered that SM be returned to CM on the basis that court intervention was no longer necessary to protect the child. The judge considered CM capable of acquiring the skill to care for her daughter adequately. The society obtained a stay of the order and unsuccessfully appealed to the Ontario Court (General Division). The Court of Appeal granted a stay of the order for return pending appeal and a motion for the introduction of fresh evidence. The new evidence concerned the consistent and repeated assertions of the child that she regarded her foster family as her real family, that she did not want to see her birth mother and that attempts to implement access visits with CM had become almost impossible because of the child's negative reactions - emotional, psychological and physical.  It allowed the appeal, set aside the order for the return of the child to the mother and ordered that the child be made a Crown ward without access for the purposes of adoption. CM appealed to the Supreme Court.",Does the child need continued protection?,Appeal dismissed.,"L'Heureux-Dubé, writing for the court, reviewed the case law and determined that when a court is determining whether the wardship should be terminated or continue, the judge should not determine whether an order of wardship should have been made in the previous or earlier hearings, but instead
now
consider whether continuation of the wardship in the current proceedings is in the best interests of the child without overlooking the parents' rights.  The review hearing is not about retrying the original need for a protection order, but rather the court should determine the circumstances of the parents or parent since the last order as it relates to the situation with respect to the child's custody, including their physical, mental and emotional state since that time and also whether there is now a lifestyle, including attitudes of the parent, that warrants the child being returned to the parent or to wardship.
She lays out a two part test:
Does the child continue to need protection and require a court order for protection?
The children's aid society must continue to justify its intervention by showing that a court order is necessary to protect the child in the future.  This does not mean that an absence of proof of a deficiency in the parent's parenting capacity is enough to return the child to the parent.  A court order may be necessary to protect the child from emotional harm which would result in future if the child were taken from its psychological parents.
What is in the best interests of the children?
This should be decided through a balancing of the considerations such as the importance of the continuity of care, the child’s physical/emotional/psychological needs, the benefit of a child's bond to his/her biological parent, as well as psychological bonding of child to his/her foster family.
The furtherance and protection of the child’s best interests must take priority over the desires and interests of the parent.
The question is not merely whether the parent has seen the light and is now prepared to be a good parent, but whether or not the parent has, in factk turned a new leaf and whether he or she is now able to give to the children the care they require?

OPENAI.gpt-4o,Miglin v Miglin,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,"The parties were married for 14 years and had four children. They operated a resort lodge in Algonquin Park in the summer and lived in Toronto in the winter. Both parties worked in the business; the husband handled the finance and the wife the day-to-day operation of the lodge. When they separated in 1993, both parties were in their early 40s and all the children were under 8 years old. The wife wanted to stay home with the children given their ages. After around fifteen months of negotiation, the parties signed an agreement, wherein:
the husband kept the lodge and his start-up business;
the wife kept the matrimonial home in Toronto (worth approximately the same as the lodge at $250,000);
the husband would pay $60,000/year in child support;
a consulting agreement providing the wife with $15,000/year for five years, renewable on consent; and
a full and final release of any future spousal support claims.
After the divorce judgment was issued in 1997, the wife's childcare obligations changed and the consulting agreement was not renewed. She applied to the court for relief, including spousal support. The trial judge referred to the husband as ""manipulative"" and ""obsessive"". The application was allowed, child support was brought in line with the
Guidelines
and the wife was awarded support of $4,400/month for five years. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment regarding spousal support, and the husband was given leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.",When should a support agreement be upheld by the courts?,Appeal allowed; original support order stands.,"Arbour and Bastarache, writing for the majority, stress finality and certainty as key principles in support agreements, citing
s. 9 of the
Divorce Act
; these are contracts and as long as they were entered into openly, the courts should enforce them.
They state that when considering whether to uphold a support agreement, there is a two stage analysis:
The formation of the agreement
: was the agreement ""unimpeachably negotiated""?
Factors to consider:
representation by counsel: the degree of professional assistance received by the party is relevant, but a court should not presume an imbalance of power.
circumstances: was one or both parties vulnerable and if so, did presence of counsel rectify this vulnerability?
duration of negotiations: was the agreement negotiated over a reasonable amount of time?
Substance of the agreement: does the agreement remain in substantial compliance with the objectives of the
Divorce Act
?
The analysis should not be restricted to the spousal support component – look at the whole agreement; the agreement as a whole should substantially comply with the factors and objectives of the
Act
(including the principles of certainty, autonomy and finality).
An agreement can be modified to bring it in line with the principles in the
Act
.
Agreement's correspondence to the parties' original intentions
: were the current circumstances anticipated when the agreement was drafted?
Foreseeability is interpreted broadly; circumstances do not have to have been explicitly considered/contemplated
Foreseeable circumstances include a change of job, assets going down in value, etc.

Generally, where negotiation of the agreement was correct and the agreement remains in substantial compliance with the
Act
, the court should defer to the wishes of the party and accord the agreement great weight.
Applying this to the case at bar:
Both parties had engaged the services of expert counsel and negotiations persisted over a lengthy period. Although the husband may have been the dominant party, the wife had adequate counsel; there was no hint of any vulnerabilities that might not be compensated by counsel.
The quantum of child support established in the agreement intended to provide the wife with a minimum amount of income in contemplation of her not working. While the wife argues that the business generates income, this was accounted for when the assets were valued and divided. The consulting contract reflects the parties' intention to provide the wife with a source of employment income for a limited time. The wife chose not to go back to the workforce, and had substantial assets even without support; there was no hardship or long-term disadvantage.
In the result, the original order should stand.
LeBel and Deschamps, in the dissent, stress very different concepts: interdependence and unequal bargaining power.  They propose a simpler test; is the agreement objectively unfair when considered now?
The dissenters disagree with the majority in two key areas.  One, the presence of counsel may not be enough to negate a power imbalance, and two, that very little deference should be given to agreements that deviate from the objectives in
s. 15.2(6)
of the
Act
; any fair agreement should reasonably realize the four stated objectives.","Establishes the test for enforcement of support agreements.

While in the 27th week of pregnancy she was driving her car when her negligent actions caused a car accident.  The fetus was permanently injured, and was born prematurely that day.  Her son, Ryan Dobson, suffered physical and mental injuries, including cerebral palsy.  His grandfather launched a tort claim for damages against his mother.  Ryan was successful at the Court of Appeal, which his mother appealed.",Should a mother be liable in tort for damages to her child arising from a prenatal negligent act that allegedly injured the fetus in her womb?,Appeal allowed.,"Cory, writing for the majority, finds that the mother should not be held liable in the situation because of the policy implications.  They employ the
Kamloops
test to determine if a duty of care should be owed.  It has two parts:
Is the relationship between the two parties close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there any public policy implications that should negate or limit the scope of the duty?
They find that the first part is satisfied; however the public policy implications negate the duty.  They state that there are two main reasons for this: it would violate the privacy and autonomy of women, and it is impossible to judicially define a reasonable standard of conduct for pregnant women.
McLachlin, in a concurring judgment, states that another main reason why this duty cannot be imposed is that it would violate pregnant women's rights under the
Charter
– specifically liberty and equality.  They would lose their liberty, and not be treated equally with other women in society.
Major, in the dissent, states that in order for the public policy implications to negate the duty they must add new restrictions on what the woman can do.  He says that this is not the case, because she had a duty of care to everyone else on the road, and extending that to the foetus would not change the reasonable standard of her conduct.  He says that this case deals specifically with pregnant women driving automobiles, and if the creation of duty imposed a limitation on her actions that was not there previously then the outcome would be different.  He uses the example with another pregnant woman in the car – if the same outcome occurred, then there is no question that the other woman's foetus could sue her for negligence.  He agrees that the
Kamloops
test applies, but says that the policy implications here do not negate the duty.","Pregnant women do not owe a duty of care to the foetus in their womb.

The seventh judge dismissed the appeal because the Nisga'a had not obtained permission from the government to sue.","Aboriginal title can survive British Columbia's entry into Confederation, and can only be extinguished by clear and plain legislation or treaty.

The Supreme Court holds that aboriginal title definitely exists, however they were split over whether or not it had been extinguished.  The majority decided that it has been extinguished by virtue of the government's exercise of control over the lands, and therefore the appeal is dismissed.  However, the dissenting judges disagree and state that more must be present to prove that the lands were extinguished.  They say that the provincial government did not have any constitutional right to deal with the land of the aboriginals, and that their predecessors before confederation did not do anything that could amount to extinguishing the lands.","Recognition of aboriginal title.

The father had sole interim custody after separation but then the parties entered into an informal shared custody arrangement where neither party paid support.  Three years later the mother brought an action in Alberta for retroactive and ongoing support.  The chambers judge awarded her prospective support but not retroactive.  The Court of Appeal allowed her appeal, but found no blameworthy conduct or willful failure to disclose on the part of the father.
Three children were born in the course of a common law relationship. After separation the children lived with the mother, and some months later the father paid $150 in child support pursuant to a maintenance agreement which was increased to $300/month following a consent order.  The mother brought an action for retroactive support.  The father had low income and high access costs and resisted the action.  The chambers judge held retroactive support would constitute hardship.
Parents married in 1984 and divorced in 1991. After separation the two children lived with their mother and a divorce judgment ordered the father to pay $700/month in child support.  In 2000 the mother signaled an intention to request increased support.  The father voluntarily increased his payments, but still below the table amount.  The mother was unaware that his income had increased dramatically as they lived in different cities.  At chambers, the judge granted her application for retroactive support based on the table amount, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal in a 2-1 judgment.
Parents divorced in 1996.  The children lived with the father, then one of the children moved to lived with the mother.  The father had a lot more income and the mother asked for an increase of support but the father rejected the request.  The mother was hesitant to take the case to court because earlier proceedings had caused a rift between the mother and children.  The chambers judge held that this was an appropriate circumstance for a retroactive award, and he calculated it from January 1, 2003 onward, to be paid in the amount of $500/month, as a ""reasonable compromise"" that best fit the situation of the parties.

To prevent liability for retroactive support, any changes in income should be reported to the custodial parent.  If this is not done and an application is brought to enforce a change, four factors should be analysed to see if retroactive support is warranted:
Undue delay: does the recipient have a reasonable excuse for not seeking support earlier?
Any voluntary, intentional choice not to apply for an increase will militate against retroactive support.  There is a balancing here; a child should not be punished for a poor choice of the parent.
Was there blameworthy conduct on the part of the payor?
This is interpreted broadly; anything that privileges the payor's interests over his/her children's right to an appropriate amount of support.
Could the payor have reasonably believed that they were discharging their support obligations?
The more significant a change in income, the more likely a court will find a payor's behaviour blameworthy if they do not proactively disclose.
Need of child/benefit: would the child benefit from retroactive award based on their needs/circumstances?
If a child's needs are being met by the current support, this will militate against a retroactive award.
Would a retroactive award cause hardship to payor?
This is a distinct element from the
s. 10
undue hardship test.
Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.

Turning to how far back retroactive payments should go, it turns on the conduct of the parents.  If there was no blameworthy behaviour, the retroactivity should go to when the custodial parent informs the payor that they are seeking additional support.  Generally there will be a limit of 3 years.  For blameworthy parents, the retroactivity should continue to when the support should have changed and did not, without limit.
As to the amount of a retroactive payment, the court should follow the
Guidelines
, but the court has broad discretion to craft a remedy that would be fair having regard to all the circumstances, including hardship on the payor.
Applying this to the cases...
This was an initial application for child support.  The parents had a shared custody arrangement that thought that meant no child support was payable (see
Contino v Leonelli-Contino
).  The incomes of the parents were relatively equal and due to the shared custody any money going to one household would simply be removed from the other.  Due to the lack of blameworthy conduct and the lack of benefit to the children, no retroactive support was awarded.
The father from whom support was being sought was low income (~$23,000/year) and he was supporting a second family.  Any retroactive award would cause his household hardship.  The access costs for him were also high.  Because of the lack of blameworthy conduct, the hardship a retroactive award would cause, and the fact that the standard of living in the custodial household was higher, no retroactive support was awarded.
In this case, the mother had broached the subject with the father but could not afford a lawyer to fight the case.  She was intimidated by her ex-husband and did not know much about his financial situation as he lived in another city.  The husband had had a huge income increase and held it from her, as well as saying that she should have managed her money better to better provide for their kids and that he was paying all he could afford.  Due to the large amount of blameworthy conduct and the large discrepancy in the amount he was paying and the table amount, the court awarded $100,000 in retroactive support.
As in
Henry
, the parties had very different incomes; the father earned more than $100,000K/year, much more than the mother, and he gave no financial support when the need arose.  The mother said she had not wanted to litigate because of the effect it had had on her daughter the last time they litigated.  The court held that the delay of mother was not unreasonable, and the father had no reasonable grounds on which to believe the level of support he was paying was reasonable, and thus the award granted at trial was upheld.
Abella, dissenting in part, had three issues with the decision of Bastarache.
The presumptive starting date of effective notice: the payor has the information on when their income changes, so it is impractical and unrealistic to expect the recipient to keep tabs on the payor’s income; the date should be when the income changes.
The role of blameworthy conduct: the conduct of the payor should be immaterial; the whole obligation depends on the income increase, conduct of the parties is irrelevant.
The three year cutoff: Abella finds this arbitrary - any cutoff of this type should be found in statute, not created by the courts.","Retroactive child support orders should no longer be rare or difficult to obtain.
Established the framework for assessing claims where there is a large, undisclosed swing in income.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?

His driver's license was cancelled by the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles. Grismer filed a complaint with the B.C. Council of Human Rights alleging discrimination based on physical disability. The Council held that the Superintendent was required to accommodate Grismer by assessing his ability to drive safely on an individual basis.,Whether the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles was required to individually assess the ability of a driver with a visual impairment to drive safely before cancelling their driver's license.,The Supreme Court of Canada upheld the decision of the B.C. Council of Human Rights.,The Court found that the Superintendent was required to accommodate persons with disabilities to the point of undue hardship. Individual assessment was necessary to determine whether a person could drive safely despite their impairment. Failure to do so constituted discrimination under the B.C. Human Rights Code.,"Before cancelling a driver's license based on a physical disability, licensing authorities must individually assess the person's ability to drive safely, accommodating them to the point of undue hardship.","The Government of British Columbia had a policy stating that it would not issue licenses to people suffering from a condition (homonymous hemianopsia (HH)) which affected eyesight.  The claimant had this condition but had driven flawlessly at work and on public roads using ""prism glasses"".  Despite this he was refused individual assessment and was not allowed to receive a license and was therefore unable to complete his job.  The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal allowed Grismer to be individually tested.  Grismer died shortly after this decision.  This was upheld by the British Columbia Supreme Court but overruled by the Court of Appeal.",Does an absolute prohibition on licensing people with a visual impairment without the possibility of individual assessment constitute discrimination?,"Appeal allowed, standard disallowed.","The court applies the
Meiorin
test, showing that it can be used in scenarios outside of the workplace to determine if discrimination is justified.  This case passes the first part because the purpose of the standard (reasonable safety) is rationally connected to the function (issuing drivers’ licenses).  It also passes the second step because there is no evidence that the standard (no licenses for HH sufferers) was adopted for any reasons other than road safety.  However the case fails the third step as the court finds that the standard (no licenses for HH) is not reasonably necessary for the purpose (reasonable safety).  The blanket prohibition doesn't let people even attempt to show that they can drive safely.
It is clear here that the accommodation would be to allow testing.  In order to succeed the government would have had to prove that to allow testing would result to undue hardship which they failed to do.  Although there are clearly safety and cost concerns involved with testing, the government didn't put in any effort to determine these values, nor did they even look for alternative ways of testing.  The court also says that in general, with the government, costs must be exorbitant to amount to undue hardship, as they are publicly funded and this would be seen as being in the public interest.  As the standard is not rationally necessary for the purpose of reasonable road safety, it amounts to discrimination and must be removed.","The
Meiorin
test applies to all standards that are thought to be discriminatory, even if they do not occur in a workplace; called bona fide justification tests.
The government will be held to a very high threshold when claiming that the costs of not adopting a standard amount to undue hardship as they are publicly funded and preventing discrimination is in the public interest."
ANTHROPIC.claude-3-opus-latest,Just v British Columbia,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,"Heavy snow fall forced Just and his daughter to stop in a line of traffic by a rocky slope on a major highway.  A boulder, which worked loose from the wooded slopes above the highway, came crashing down on the appellant's car, killing the appellant's daughter and causing him very serious injuries.  Just brought an action against the provincial government contending that the government negligently failed to properly maintain the highway.
The Department of Highways had set up a system for inspection and remedial work upon rock slopes.  Inspection and recommendations were made by engineers and the work was effected by a rock scaling crew responsible for performing remedial work throughout the entire province.  The department's practice had been to make visual inspections from the highway unless rock falls or a history of instability in an area indicated a need for the rock engineer to climb the slope.  Numerous informal inspections were carried out by highway personnel as they drove along the road.
The trial judge found that the entire system of inspection and the way it was implemented was a policy matter which did not give rise to liability. No finding was made as to whether or not the system of inspection was reasonable or whether the inspections themselves were properly carried out. The Court of Appeal upheld the finding of the trial judge and Just appealled to the Supreme Court.","Is the government under a duty of care to maintain the highways and if so, are they liable if the highways are not sufficiently maintained?","Appeal allowed, new trial ordered.","Cory, writing for the majority, held that the province owes a duty of care, which ordinarily extends to their reasonable maintenance, to those using its highways.  The Department of Highways could readily foresee the risk that harm might befall users of a highway if it were not reasonably maintained.  That maintenance could be found to extend to the prevention of injury from falling rock.
Government agencies may be exempt from the application of the traditional tort law duty of care if an explicit statutory exemption exists or if the decision arose as a result of a policy decision.  Whether or not a decision is characterized as a policy decision or as an operational decision rests on the nature of the decision and not on the identity of the actors.  Generally, decisions concerning budgetary allotments for departments or government agencies should be classified as policy decisions.  A policy decision may be open to challenge on the basis that it is not made in the bona fide exercise of discretion.  If after due consideration it is found that a duty of care is owed by the government agency and no exemption by way of statute or policy decision-making is found to exist, a traditional torts analysis ensues (as per
Anns v Merton London Borough Council
) and the issue of standard of care required of the government agency must next be considered.  The manner and quality of an inspection system, since it was clearly part of the operational aspect of a governmental activity, should be assessed when consideration is given to the standard of care issue.  At this stage, the requisite standard of care must be assessed in light of all the surrounding circumstances including budgetary restraints and the availability of qualified personnel and equipment.
Sopinka, in the dissent, held that the government had the power to carry out the inspections but was under no duty to do so.  Conduct within the limits of this discretion gives rise to no duty of care; conduct outside of these limits may attract a private law duty of care.
A litigant may not attack a policy and it is not appropriate for a Court to pass on it, absent evidence that a policy was adopted for some ulterior motive and not for a municipal purpose.  In order for a private duty to arise, it would have to be shown that the Rockwork Section acted outside its delegated discretion to determine whether to inspect and the manner in which the inspection is to be made.  Policy decisions are immune from review because they usually entail not only a decision to do something but also some call upon the public purse.  The government was acting within its discretion when it decided that inspections should be done and the manner in which they were to be done.  Responsibility for deciding the extent to which the inspection program was to be implemented was delegated to the Rockwork Section.","The duty of care should apply to a public authority unless there is a valid basis for its exclusion.
Policy decisions – the decision by the government about what acts to perform under a given statute – are exempt from liability; operational decisions – the decision by the government about how to perform those acts once they have been decided - are not exempt from liability."

On appeal Bell is arguing that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal process is unfair because the Canadian Human Rights Commission makes regulations that the Tribunal must follow, and then appears in front of them seeking favorable decisions.  They claim that this constitutes a conflict of interest and a lack of necessary ""judicial"" independence.",Does the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal lack independence and impartiality because of the power of the Canadian Human Rights Commission to issue binding guidelines for them before they appear in front of them?,"Appeal dismissed, case to proceed to Tribunal.","The court recognizes that Bell's claims are not without merit, however after consideration they dismiss them.  The court held that Bell did not provide sufficient evidence for their claims and also because they misunderstand impartiality - it does not mean having the freedom to decide a case however one wishes to, being subject to certain binding principles is perfectly legitimate for an impartial judiciary.  Further, the Commission cannot create guidelines that favour them in the Tribunal, because to do so would be
ultra vires

Canadian Human Rights Act
and the Tribunal is not bound by any such guidelines.  The powers that the Commission has to enact guidelines under
s.27(2)

ANTHROPIC.claude-3-opus-latest,Catholic Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto v CM,"The appellant society apprehended a child born to the respondent, an unmarried Roman Catholic mother, and placed the child for adoption. The natural mother sought an order that the child be returned to her.",Whether the child should be returned to the natural mother or remain in the custody of the appellant society for adoption.,The appeal was allowed. The child is to remain in the custody of the appellant society for the purpose of adoption.,"The trial judge erred in his interpretation and application of the relevant statutory provisions. The society has wardship of the child, and the child's best interests would be served by remaining in the custody of the adoptive parents, with whom the child has bonded. The natural mother's revocation of her consent to adoption was not effective, as it was not given in accordance with the statute.","In determining the best interests of the child in a custody dispute between the natural parent and an adoption agency, the court must consider the relevant statutory provisions and the child's bonded relationship with the prospective adoptive parents.","The aid society took SM into protection on several occasions and supervised her mother, CM, on parenting skills. On consent, SM was made a ward of the society 1989. Throughout the wardship, the society continued to work with CM and facilitated regular visits with SM, however, bonding between mother and daughter remained minimal. In December 1989, after a second four-month wardship, the society brought a status review application seeking an order of Crown wardship without access for the purposes of adoption. CM opposed the motion and the matter was dealt with sporadically throughout 1991. In February 1992 the Ontario Provincial Court ordered that SM be returned to CM on the basis that court intervention was no longer necessary to protect the child. The judge considered CM capable of acquiring the skill to care for her daughter adequately. The society obtained a stay of the order and unsuccessfully appealed to the Ontario Court (General Division). The Court of Appeal granted a stay of the order for return pending appeal and a motion for the introduction of fresh evidence. The new evidence concerned the consistent and repeated assertions of the child that she regarded her foster family as her real family, that she did not want to see her birth mother and that attempts to implement access visits with CM had become almost impossible because of the child's negative reactions - emotional, psychological and physical.  It allowed the appeal, set aside the order for the return of the child to the mother and ordered that the child be made a Crown ward without access for the purposes of adoption. CM appealed to the Supreme Court.",Does the child need continued protection?,Appeal dismissed.,"L'Heureux-Dubé, writing for the court, reviewed the case law and determined that when a court is determining whether the wardship should be terminated or continue, the judge should not determine whether an order of wardship should have been made in the previous or earlier hearings, but instead
now
consider whether continuation of the wardship in the current proceedings is in the best interests of the child without overlooking the parents' rights.  The review hearing is not about retrying the original need for a protection order, but rather the court should determine the circumstances of the parents or parent since the last order as it relates to the situation with respect to the child's custody, including their physical, mental and emotional state since that time and also whether there is now a lifestyle, including attitudes of the parent, that warrants the child being returned to the parent or to wardship.
She lays out a two part test:
Does the child continue to need protection and require a court order for protection?
The children's aid society must continue to justify its intervention by showing that a court order is necessary to protect the child in the future.  This does not mean that an absence of proof of a deficiency in the parent's parenting capacity is enough to return the child to the parent.  A court order may be necessary to protect the child from emotional harm which would result in future if the child were taken from its psychological parents.
What is in the best interests of the children?
This should be decided through a balancing of the considerations such as the importance of the continuity of care, the child’s physical/emotional/psychological needs, the benefit of a child's bond to his/her biological parent, as well as psychological bonding of child to his/her foster family.
The furtherance and protection of the child’s best interests must take priority over the desires and interests of the parent.
The question is not merely whether the parent has seen the light and is now prepared to be a good parent, but whether or not the parent has, in factk turned a new leaf and whether he or she is now able to give to the children the care they require?

The report was prepared primarily for the owner of the project, not for the benefit of contractors like Edgeworth.","For a claim of negligent misrepresentation to succeed, there must be a special relationship between the parties such that reliance by the plaintiff was reasonable and foreseeable.

MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,Calder et al. v British Columbia (Attorney General),"The case involved a challenge to the constitutionality of certain provisions of the British Columbia Human Rights Code.  Specifically, the provisions that dealt with discrimination on the basis of sex and gender identity. Several individuals and organizations, represented by the appellants (Calder et al.), alleged that these provisions were inconsistent with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Bill of Rights. The appellants argued that certain aspects of the code were vague and ambiguous, resulting in possible application against constitutionally protected activities.  They challenged the scope and implementation of the code.  (Details of specific provisions or named organizations are not central to this factual summary)","Whether certain provisions of the British Columbia Human Rights Code, particularly those dealing with sex and gender identity, violated the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Bill of Rights, given concerns regarding vagueness and potential application against constitutionally protected activities.",The appeal was dismissed.,"The court found that the challenged provisions of the code were sufficiently clear and did not infringe on the Charter or the Bill of Rights. The court determined that the code, though potentially broad in its reach, provided necessary protection against discrimination. The court did not find the vagueness concerns raised by the appellants to be persuasive enough to invalidate the provisions in question. They acknowledged the potential for subjective interpretations but emphasized the need for the challenged code to facilitate the important goal of eliminating discrimination. Further, the court did not accept the claims about specific instances of potentially violating constitutionally protected activities. ","A human rights code can contain provisions broad enough to encompass potential discrimination, even if potentially subjective in their application, without violating fundamental rights.  While vagueness is a concern, a code of this nature is essential for addressing discrimination and, in this case, did not infringe upon the constitutional rights at issue.","The appellants are representative of the Nishga Tribe of British Columbia.  They claim that the aboriginal title over a piece of land in British Columbia that had been present before Confederation had never been extinguished, and that the tribe therefore still had title to the land.  This claim was denied at trial and upheld at appeal.","Do the alleged aboriginal land claims exist?
If the claims exist, were they extinguished?",Appeal dismissed.,"At trial and upon initial appeal the courts decided that if there ever was aboriginal title, it was surely extinguished upon confederation.  The Supreme Court holds that aboriginal title definitely exists, however they were split over whether or not it had been extinguished.  The majority decided that it has been extinguished by virtue of the government's exercise of control over the lands, and therefore the appeal is dismissed.  However, the dissenting judges disagree and state that more must be present to prove that the lands were extinguished.  They say that the provincial government did not have any constitutional right to deal with the land of the aboriginals, and that their predecessors before confederation did not do anything that could amount to extinguishing the lands.","Recognition of aboriginal title.

She was sent away from her mother, who cared for her, during the week so that she could attend a special school.  Her mother was seeking the court's permission to perform a sterilization procedure (hysterectomy) on her daughter.  There was considerable evidence that the daughter would be incapable of handling the burdens of motherhood.  Eve had struck up a friendship with a boy from school, and discussed marriage, and her mother is afraid of the burden that would be placed on Eve, and ultimately upon herself to look after a child if pregnancy ensued.  Permission was denied at trial, but granted at the Court of Appeal.",Can a caregiver for someone incapable of giving informed consent make decisions about surgeries for the incapable individual?,Appeal allowed.,"La Forest, writing for a unanimous court, discusses the history of
parens patriae
jurisdiction, which states that the state is responsible for decisions concerning those that cannot give informed consent themselves. He says that the test is generally that the only procedures that will be allowed are ones that are in the ""best interests"" of the protected person. He focuses his criticism in this case on the fact that Mrs. E. is claiming that the burden on her to look after the child should be considered in making the decision. La Forest states that this should be given no consideration, as it is only the best interests of the protected person that are of concern.
He also says that arguing about the protected person's fitness as a parents involves value-loaded questions that result in a designation of disabled persons as less competent parents, even though there is significant evidence showing that they show as much fondness and concern for their children as anyone else. He also considers that the procedure of a hysterectomy is serious surgery and quite invasive, and further that Eve does not require assistance caring for her reproductive cycle, which is a concern in other cases. Perhaps most importantly, this surgery is not therapeutic.
La Forest concludes that ""the grave intrusion on a person’s rights and the certain physical damage that ensues from non-therapeutic sterilization without consent, when compared to the highly questionable advantages that can result, [show that] it can never safely be determined that such a procedure is for the benefit of the person."" The procedure should never be authorized for non-therapeutic purposes under the

The father had sole interim custody after separation but then the parties entered into an informal shared custody arrangement where neither party paid support.  Three years later the mother brought an action in Alberta for retroactive and ongoing support.  The chambers judge awarded her prospective support but not retroactive.  The Court of Appeal allowed her appeal, but found no blameworthy conduct or willful failure to disclose on the part of the father.
Three children were born in the course of a common law relationship. After separation the children lived with the mother, and some months later the father paid $150 in child support pursuant to a maintenance agreement which was increased to $300/month following a consent order.  The mother brought an action for retroactive support.  The father had low income and high access costs and resisted the action.  The chambers judge held retroactive support would constitute hardship.
Parents married in 1984 and divorced in 1991. After separation the two children lived with their mother and a divorce judgment ordered the father to pay $700/month in child support.  In 2000 the mother signaled an intention to request increased support.  The father voluntarily increased his payments, but still below the table amount.  The mother was unaware that his income had increased dramatically as they lived in different cities.  At chambers, the judge granted her application for retroactive support based on the table amount, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal in a 2-1 judgment.
Parents divorced in 1996.  The children lived with the father, then one of the children moved to lived with the mother.  The father had a lot more income and the mother asked for an increase of support but the father rejected the request.  The mother was hesitant to take the case to court because earlier proceedings had caused a rift between the mother and children.  The chambers judge held that this was an appropriate circumstance for a retroactive award, and he calculated it from January 1, 2003 onward, to be paid in the amount of $500/month, as a ""reasonable compromise"" that best fit the situation of the parties.

To prevent liability for retroactive support, any changes in income should be reported to the custodial parent.  If this is not done and an application is brought to enforce a change, four factors should be analysed to see if retroactive support is warranted:
Undue delay: does the recipient have a reasonable excuse for not seeking support earlier?
Any voluntary, intentional choice not to apply for an increase will militate against retroactive support.  There is a balancing here; a child should not be punished for a poor choice of the parent.
Was there blameworthy conduct on the part of the payor?
This is interpreted broadly; anything that privileges the payor's interests over his/her children's right to an appropriate amount of support.
Could the payor have reasonably believed that they were discharging their support obligations?
The more significant a change in income, the more likely a court will find a payor's behaviour blameworthy if they do not proactively disclose.
Need of child/benefit: would the child benefit from retroactive award based on their needs/circumstances?
If a child's needs are being met by the current support, this will militate against a retroactive award.
Would a retroactive award cause hardship to payor?
This is a distinct element from the
s. 10
undue hardship test.
Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.

Turning to how far back retroactive payments should go, it turns on the conduct of the parents.  If there was no blameworthy behaviour, the retroactivity should go to when the custodial parent informs the payor that they are seeking additional support.  Generally there will be a limit of 3 years.  For blameworthy parents, the retroactivity should continue to when the support should have changed and did not, without limit.
As to the amount of a retroactive payment, the court should follow the
Guidelines
, but the court has broad discretion to craft a remedy that would be fair having regard to all the circumstances, including hardship on the payor.
Applying this to the cases...
This was an initial application for child support.  The parents had a shared custody arrangement that thought that meant no child support was payable (see
Contino v Leonelli-Contino
).  The incomes of the parents were relatively equal and due to the shared custody any money going to one household would simply be removed from the other.  Due to the lack of blameworthy conduct and the lack of benefit to the children, no retroactive support was awarded.
The father from whom support was being sought was low income (~$23,000/year) and he was supporting a second family.  Any retroactive award would cause his household hardship.  The access costs for him were also high.  Because of the lack of blameworthy conduct, the hardship a retroactive award would cause, and the fact that the standard of living in the custodial household was higher, no retroactive support was awarded.
In this case, the mother had broached the subject with the father but could not afford a lawyer to fight the case.  She was intimidated by her ex-husband and did not know much about his financial situation as he lived in another city.  The husband had had a huge income increase and held it from her, as well as saying that she should have managed her money better to better provide for their kids and that he was paying all he could afford.  Due to the large amount of blameworthy conduct and the large discrepancy in the amount he was paying and the table amount, the court awarded $100,000 in retroactive support.
As in
Henry
, the parties had very different incomes; the father earned more than $100,000K/year, much more than the mother, and he gave no financial support when the need arose.  The mother said she had not wanted to litigate because of the effect it had had on her daughter the last time they litigated.  The court held that the delay of mother was not unreasonable, and the father had no reasonable grounds on which to believe the level of support he was paying was reasonable, and thus the award granted at trial was upheld.
Abella, dissenting in part, had three issues with the decision of Bastarache.
The presumptive starting date of effective notice: the payor has the information on when their income changes, so it is impractical and unrealistic to expect the recipient to keep tabs on the payor’s income; the date should be when the income changes.
The role of blameworthy conduct: the conduct of the payor should be immaterial; the whole obligation depends on the income increase, conduct of the parties is irrelevant.
The three year cutoff: Abella finds this arbitrary - any cutoff of this type should be found in statute, not created by the courts.","Retroactive child support orders should no longer be rare or difficult to obtain.
Established the framework for assessing claims where there is a large, undisclosed swing in income.

the province?",Appeal dismissed.,"Judson, writing for the majority, held that ""the power of a provincial legislature to enact legislation for the regulation of highway traffic is undoubted"".  He reaffirmed the principle that there exists a ""general area"" or ""domain"" of criminal law and the two governments can make law on the same matter by creating a distinction between the types of culpability.  He quotes from Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law:
There are only two states of mind which constitute
mens rea
, and they are intention and recklessness. The difference between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; they are opposed and it is a logical fallacy to suggest that recklessness is a degree of negligence. The common habit of lawyers to qualify the word ""negligence"" with some moral epithet such as ""wicked"", ""gross"", or ""culpable"" has been most unfortunate since it has inevitably led to great confusion of thought and of principle. It is equally misleading to speak of criminal negligence since this is merely to use an expression to explain itself.
On the facts, Judson found that there was overlap between the laws however ""there is no conflict between these provisions in the sense that they are repugnant"". The provincial law extended to include ""inadvertent negligence"" as well as regular negligence. It was enough that “the two pieces of legislation differed both in legislative purpose and legal and practical effect” to justify both of them.","The distinction between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; recklessness is when an actor does not desire harmful consequences but forsees the possibility and consciously takes the risk.
There must be an operational incompatibility between federal and provincial law to invoke paramountcy."
MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,Canada (Attorney General) v Mossup,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,"Mossop is a gay man, and his partner's father died.  He applied to take bereavement leave from his job to go to the funeral, but is denied because his partner is neither a ""spouse"" nor a ""common law partner"" as they are both required to be of the opposite sex.  He makes a claim to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, but refuses to argue sexual orientation as a ground, and instead will only argue family status, stating that all matters to do with homosexuals are not about sexual orientation by definition.  The case was dismissed in the lower courts.","Can a homosexual man claim discrimination against ""family status"" with his partner under
s.3 of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
?",Appeal dismissed..,"The court is upset with the appellant who refused to deal with the claim on the ground of sexual orientation, which was new at the time.  However, Mossop sticks with family status.  The majority says that you cannot interpret ""family status"" to include Mossop’s situation unless you also discuss the ground of sexual orientation, and as Mossop refuses to do so he cannot be successful.
La Forest
concurs, but instead looks to the definitions in the Act and tries to figure out what the government meant to protect under ""family status"".  He determines that this specific field was not intended to be covered.
In the dissent,
L'Heureux-Dubé
says that ""family status"" should have a very broad interpretation.  She looks to the broader social context of limiting it as the majority does, and further that by looking at the plain meaning given in the statute you are really just taking the majority's opinion of the definition, which is exactly what you try to avoid in human rights issues.  She also suggests that when there are overlapping grounds, you should select the one that will succeed and proceed with that one.","Only identified grounds can be pursued in a human rights claim.
Definitions in human rights legislation are generally interpreted broadly, but the definition given by Parliament in the statute has a good deal of authority in the court's decision on what falls under the definition and what does not."
MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v British Columbia (Council of Human Rights) (Re Grismer Estate),"The Grismer Estate was denied a driver's license renewal by the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles due to the deceased driver's disability.  The Council of Human Rights determined that the denial violated the deceased's human rights.  The issue concerned whether the Superintendent's refusal was justified under the applicable legislation.  The driver had a medical condition that, according to the Superintendent, made her unfit to drive.",Was the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles' refusal to renew the driver's license justified under the relevant human rights legislation?,The Superintendent's decision was found to be discriminatory and therefore unlawful.,"The Council of Human Rights found the Superintendent's decision to be inconsistent with human rights legislation.  It considered the criteria for assessing fitness to drive and if the driver's condition, which was a recognized disability, affected her driving ability.  The Council determined that the Superintendent hadn't adequately demonstrated a rational link between the driver's disability and an inability to safely operate a vehicle.","The Superintendent of Motor Vehicles must demonstrate a rational connection between a driver's disability and an inability to safely operate a vehicle when denying a license renewal, and if the link is not clearly established, the denial can be considered discriminatory and unlawful.","The Government of British Columbia had a policy stating that it would not issue licenses to people suffering from a condition (homonymous hemianopsia (HH)) which affected eyesight.  The claimant had this condition but had driven flawlessly at work and on public roads using ""prism glasses"".  Despite this he was refused individual assessment and was not allowed to receive a license and was therefore unable to complete his job.  The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal allowed Grismer to be individually tested.  Grismer died shortly after this decision.  This was upheld by the British Columbia Supreme Court but overruled by the Court of Appeal.",Does an absolute prohibition on licensing people with a visual impairment without the possibility of individual assessment constitute discrimination?,"Appeal allowed, standard disallowed.","The court applies the
Meiorin
test, showing that it can be used in scenarios outside of the workplace to determine if discrimination is justified.  This case passes the first part because the purpose of the standard (reasonable safety) is rationally connected to the function (issuing drivers’ licenses).  It also passes the second step because there is no evidence that the standard (no licenses for HH sufferers) was adopted for any reasons other than road safety.  However the case fails the third step as the court finds that the standard (no licenses for HH) is not reasonably necessary for the purpose (reasonable safety).  The blanket prohibition doesn't let people even attempt to show that they can drive safely.
It is clear here that the accommodation would be to allow testing.  In order to succeed the government would have had to prove that to allow testing would result to undue hardship which they failed to do.  Although there are clearly safety and cost concerns involved with testing, the government didn't put in any effort to determine these values, nor did they even look for alternative ways of testing.  The court also says that in general, with the government, costs must be exorbitant to amount to undue hardship, as they are publicly funded and this would be seen as being in the public interest.  As the standard is not rationally necessary for the purpose of reasonable road safety, it amounts to discrimination and must be removed.","The
Meiorin
test applies to all standards that are thought to be discriminatory, even if they do not occur in a workplace; called bona fide justification tests.
The government will be held to a very high threshold when claiming that the costs of not adopting a standard amount to undue hardship as they are publicly funded and preventing discrimination is in the public interest."
MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,Just v British Columbia,"A woman, Ms. Just, was a long-time resident of British Columbia, Canada.  She claimed to have suffered severe emotional distress and mental health issues due to the government's handling of a particular social program. She sought compensation from the Province for these claims.

The program was intended to provide support for individuals suffering from particular social and psychological difficulties and was intended to improve quality of life.

The Province argued that it was not liable for Ms. Just's suffering as it had not acted with a specific intent to harm her, and its actions were within the ambit of its general social welfare powers.","Whether the Province of British Columbia could be held liable for the claimant's emotional distress resulting from the government's handling of a social program, in the absence of any specific intent to cause harm.",The court held that the Province was not liable for Ms. Just's emotional distress.,"The court emphasized the distinction between negligence and intent in cases involving governmental action.  The court reasoned that the Province's actions, although potentially having unforeseen consequences, did not arise from a specific intention to cause harm to Ms. Just. The court also recognized the inherent challenges in holding the Province accountable for the myriad impacts of broad social programs and policies.",A government is not liable for emotional distress arising from the implementation of social programs unless it acted with specific intent to cause harm.  The potential for negative side effects or unforeseen consequences of government policies or actions does not automatically translate into legal liability.,"Heavy snow fall forced Just and his daughter to stop in a line of traffic by a rocky slope on a major highway.  A boulder, which worked loose from the wooded slopes above the highway, came crashing down on the appellant's car, killing the appellant's daughter and causing him very serious injuries.  Just brought an action against the provincial government contending that the government negligently failed to properly maintain the highway.
The Department of Highways had set up a system for inspection and remedial work upon rock slopes.  Inspection and recommendations were made by engineers and the work was effected by a rock scaling crew responsible for performing remedial work throughout the entire province.  The department's practice had been to make visual inspections from the highway unless rock falls or a history of instability in an area indicated a need for the rock engineer to climb the slope.  Numerous informal inspections were carried out by highway personnel as they drove along the road.
The trial judge found that the entire system of inspection and the way it was implemented was a policy matter which did not give rise to liability. No finding was made as to whether or not the system of inspection was reasonable or whether the inspections themselves were properly carried out. The Court of Appeal upheld the finding of the trial judge and Just appealled to the Supreme Court.","Is the government under a duty of care to maintain the highways and if so, are they liable if the highways are not sufficiently maintained?","Appeal allowed, new trial ordered.","Cory, writing for the majority, held that the province owes a duty of care, which ordinarily extends to their reasonable maintenance, to those using its highways.  The Department of Highways could readily foresee the risk that harm might befall users of a highway if it were not reasonably maintained.  That maintenance could be found to extend to the prevention of injury from falling rock.
Government agencies may be exempt from the application of the traditional tort law duty of care if an explicit statutory exemption exists or if the decision arose as a result of a policy decision.  Whether or not a decision is characterized as a policy decision or as an operational decision rests on the nature of the decision and not on the identity of the actors.  Generally, decisions concerning budgetary allotments for departments or government agencies should be classified as policy decisions.  A policy decision may be open to challenge on the basis that it is not made in the bona fide exercise of discretion.  If after due consideration it is found that a duty of care is owed by the government agency and no exemption by way of statute or policy decision-making is found to exist, a traditional torts analysis ensues (as per
Anns v Merton London Borough Council
) and the issue of standard of care required of the government agency must next be considered.  The manner and quality of an inspection system, since it was clearly part of the operational aspect of a governmental activity, should be assessed when consideration is given to the standard of care issue.  At this stage, the requisite standard of care must be assessed in light of all the surrounding circumstances including budgetary restraints and the availability of qualified personnel and equipment.
Sopinka, in the dissent, held that the government had the power to carry out the inspections but was under no duty to do so.  Conduct within the limits of this discretion gives rise to no duty of care; conduct outside of these limits may attract a private law duty of care.
A litigant may not attack a policy and it is not appropriate for a Court to pass on it, absent evidence that a policy was adopted for some ulterior motive and not for a municipal purpose.  In order for a private duty to arise, it would have to be shown that the Rockwork Section acted outside its delegated discretion to determine whether to inspect and the manner in which the inspection is to be made.  Policy decisions are immune from review because they usually entail not only a decision to do something but also some call upon the public purse.  The government was acting within its discretion when it decided that inspections should be done and the manner in which they were to be done.  Responsibility for deciding the extent to which the inspection program was to be implemented was delegated to the Rockwork Section.","The duty of care should apply to a public authority unless there is a valid basis for its exclusion.
Policy decisions – the decision by the government about what acts to perform under a given statute – are exempt from liability; operational decisions – the decision by the government about how to perform those acts once they have been decided - are not exempt from liability."
MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,Machtinger v HOJ Industries Ltd.,"A plaintiff, Machtinger, was an employee of HOJ Industries Ltd.  He was dismissed from his position for alleged insubordination.  Machtinger was not given a formal hearing or opportunity to present his case before his dismissal.","Whether an employer's dismissal of an employee without a hearing, when the dismissal is based on serious misconduct, constitutes a breach of the duty of fair dealing in the context of employment contracts.",The dismissal was held to be wrongful.,"The court held that an employer's right to dismiss an employee for just cause does not eliminate the employer's duty to act fairly in the process of dismissal.  The lack of a hearing, coupled with the serious nature of the alleged misconduct, led the court to find the dismissal unfair.  The court stressed the importance of procedural fairness in employment relationships.","An employer, even when dismissing an employee for just cause, must act fairly and accord the employee a fair hearing, particularly when the misconduct alleged is serious.  Denial of a hearing and opportunity to present one's case in such circumstances constitutes a breach of the implied duty of fair dealing in an employment contract.","Both appellants began working for HOJ Industries, a car dealer, in 1978, and were discharged in 1985 without cause.  At the time they were dismissed Machtinger was credit manager and rust‑proofing sales manager and Lefebvre was sales manager.  Each had entered into a contract for employment for an indefinite period which contained a clause allowing the respondent to terminate his employment without cause, in Machtinger's case without notice and in Lefebvre's case on two weeks' notice.  Under the provincial
Employment Standards Act
the appellants were entitled to a minimum notice period of four weeks.  After they were dismissed, the respondent paid each of them the equivalent of four weeks' salary.  The appellants brought action for wrongful dismissal and the trial judge found that they were entitled to reasonable notice of termination, and that the period of reasonable notice for Machtinger was 7 months and for Lefebvre, 7½ months, however this was overturned by the Court of Appeal.",What should the notice period be in order to terminate employment if notice required in employment contract violates legislated standards?,"Appeal allowed, lower court judgment restored.","McLachlin, writing a concurring judgment, examined the legal principles governing the implication of terms.  She identifies three types of implied terms:
terms implied by fact (intention required);
terms implied by law (no intention required); and
terms implied by custom and usage,
and identifies #2 as the type the courts will read into a contract.  Implication of law can be from custom, for business efficiency (what is necessary in a contract), or what is reasonable (from Denning's dissent in
Liverpool City Council v Irwin
).
She finds that the Court of Appeal erred in characterizing a term implied in law as a term implied in fact, which brought in the intentionality of the parties.  Holding that the employer had a legal obligation to provide reasonable notice and that this can only be displaced by an express contrary agreement, the court imposed a reasonable term of notification on HOJ; HOJ industries.","Terms can be implied by the court based on:
custom or usage;

MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,Homex Realty and Development Co. Ltd. v Wyoming (Village),"Homex Realty and Development Co. Ltd. (Homex) sought to develop a parcel of land in the Village of Wyoming. The Village of Wyoming (Village) denied Homex's application for a development permit. Homex appealed the denial to the Wyoming Zoning Board of Adjustment (Zoning Board), which affirmed the Village's decision. Homex then appealed to the Wyoming District Court, which upheld the decision of the Zoning Board. Homex appealed to the Wyoming Supreme Court. The case involves issues relating to the interpretation of zoning regulations, particularly with regards to development permits.",Whether the Village of Wyoming's denial of Homex's development permit was in accordance with the applicable zoning regulations?,Affirmed.,"The Wyoming Supreme Court reviewed the applicable zoning regulations and found that the Village's denial of the development permit was consistent with those regulations.  The court examined the specific provisions related to lot size, setbacks, and density, concluding the Village's interpretation of these regulations and its application to Homex's proposal were permissible under the law. The Zoning Board's decision was upheld on the grounds of proper procedural adherence to applicable zoning ordinances and valid interpretation of regulations.","Wyoming's zoning regulations, properly interpreted and applied, are sufficient grounds for denying a development permit.  The Village's actions, in upholding the regulations and refusing a permit that didn't meet those requirements, were consistent with their authority. The court's decision is based on the specific regulations in place in the Village of Wyoming.","As a condition of registration of a plan of subdivision in the Village of Wyoming, Atkinson, the owner and subdivider of the parcel of land, entered into an agreement with the Village for the installation of municipal services in the subdivision. This agreement, dated January 22, 1968, and registered September 26, 1975, provided in a general way for the owner's providing ""all the requirements financial and otherwise, of the Corporation re surfacing of roads, installation of services and drainage"". The agreement also prevented the sale of the lands in question until the agreement had been fully carried out, except with the consent of the Village, but the provision did not provide that consent would operate to release Atkinson from his obligation to the Village. Before any services were installed, Homex bought the great majority of the lots on the subdivision with the Village's consent. There was some question as to whether or not Homex had undertaken to assume the obligations of the original subdivider. Nevertheless, when protracted negotiations between the Village and Homex concerning the installation of services proved fruitless, the Village, in April 1976, pursuant to s. 29(3) (now
s. 50(3)
) of the
Planning Act
and without notice to Homex, enacted by-law 7 deeming the lots purchased by Homex not to be a registered plan of subdivision. Homex, in September 1976, made application for judicial review for an order quashing by-law 7 and, while the application was pending, checkerboarded its lots.
In November 1975, Homex and the Village negotiated the installation of services along the only street requiring them. By-law 6, enacted in December 1975, provided that it was the policy of the Village that it would neither assume responsibility for a water pipeline constructed by Homex nor permit its connection to the municipal water supply system. Homex coupled an application in judicial review to quash by-law 6 with the application for an order to quash by-law 7.","What qualifies as a ""legislative"" decision such that no duty of procedural fairness applies?",Appeal dismissed.,"Estey, writing for the majority, held that while the passage of By-law 7 had some characteristics of a community interest, it was also clearly the culmination of the dispute between the village and Homex.  As a result he found that the decision was quasi-judicial such as to attract the principle of notice and the doctrine of
audi alteram partem
.  Despite this, however, he held that the conduct of Homex to rid itself of the obligations under the agreement with Atkinson were such that it should be denied a discretionary remedy.  There was also no basis to challenge By-law 6 as it simply stated the facts of the agreement with Atkinson.
Dickson, in the dissent, is quoted:
The courts long ago developed the general proposition that wherever a statute authorizes the interference with property or other rights and is silent as to whether or not the agency in question is required to give notice prior to the intervention in such rights, the courts will ""supply the omission of the legislature"" and require the agency in question to afford the subject an opportunity of being heard before it proceeds.
He held that an act could not be labelled ""legislative"" merely for the purpose of dispensing with fairness. It was not particularly important that the function of the municipality was classified as ""legislative"" or ""quasi-judicial"", rather, it was necessary to look at the nature of the function and to the facts of each case. The by-law in question was not of wide and general application, but was rather aimed at deliberately limiting the rights of Homex, entitling it to some procedural safeguards - at a minimum, notice of the proposed by-law and the opportunity to be heard.","In general, the courts have not imposed procedural requirements on the subordinate law-making function.
The facts of each case are key to determining the level of procedural fairness required."

The court held that Bell did not provide sufficient evidence for their claims and also because they misunderstand impartiality - it does not mean having the freedom to decide a case however one wishes to, being subject to certain binding principles is perfectly legitimate for an impartial judiciary.  Further, the Commission cannot create guidelines that favour them in the Tribunal, because to do so would be

MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,Catholic Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto v CM,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,"The aid society took SM into protection on several occasions and supervised her mother, CM, on parenting skills. On consent, SM was made a ward of the society 1989. Throughout the wardship, the society continued to work with CM and facilitated regular visits with SM, however, bonding between mother and daughter remained minimal. In December 1989, after a second four-month wardship, the society brought a status review application seeking an order of Crown wardship without access for the purposes of adoption. CM opposed the motion and the matter was dealt with sporadically throughout 1991. In February 1992 the Ontario Provincial Court ordered that SM be returned to CM on the basis that court intervention was no longer necessary to protect the child. The judge considered CM capable of acquiring the skill to care for her daughter adequately. The society obtained a stay of the order and unsuccessfully appealed to the Ontario Court (General Division). The Court of Appeal granted a stay of the order for return pending appeal and a motion for the introduction of fresh evidence. The new evidence concerned the consistent and repeated assertions of the child that she regarded her foster family as her real family, that she did not want to see her birth mother and that attempts to implement access visits with CM had become almost impossible because of the child's negative reactions - emotional, psychological and physical.  It allowed the appeal, set aside the order for the return of the child to the mother and ordered that the child be made a Crown ward without access for the purposes of adoption. CM appealed to the Supreme Court.",Does the child need continued protection?,Appeal dismissed.,"L'Heureux-Dubé, writing for the court, reviewed the case law and determined that when a court is determining whether the wardship should be terminated or continue, the judge should not determine whether an order of wardship should have been made in the previous or earlier hearings, but instead
now
consider whether continuation of the wardship in the current proceedings is in the best interests of the child without overlooking the parents' rights.  The review hearing is not about retrying the original need for a protection order, but rather the court should determine the circumstances of the parents or parent since the last order as it relates to the situation with respect to the child's custody, including their physical, mental and emotional state since that time and also whether there is now a lifestyle, including attitudes of the parent, that warrants the child being returned to the parent or to wardship.
She lays out a two part test:
Does the child continue to need protection and require a court order for protection?
The children's aid society must continue to justify its intervention by showing that a court order is necessary to protect the child in the future.  This does not mean that an absence of proof of a deficiency in the parent's parenting capacity is enough to return the child to the parent.  A court order may be necessary to protect the child from emotional harm which would result in future if the child were taken from its psychological parents.
What is in the best interests of the children?
This should be decided through a balancing of the considerations such as the importance of the continuity of care, the child’s physical/emotional/psychological needs, the benefit of a child's bond to his/her biological parent, as well as psychological bonding of child to his/her foster family.
The furtherance and protection of the child’s best interests must take priority over the desires and interests of the parent.
The question is not merely whether the parent has seen the light and is now prepared to be a good parent, but whether or not the parent has, in factk turned a new leaf and whether he or she is now able to give to the children the care they require?

Between the lack of bonding with the birth mother and the bonding with the foster family, it would be in the best interests of the child to be made a ward of the respondent society, with a view to her adoption by her foster family.",Two stage test for review of a protection order.

The court determined that Lea's engineering drawings and specifications were inadequate, incomplete, and contained errors that significantly impacted the project's timeline and budget.  These shortcomings were a breach of the implied terms of the contract, specifically the duty of care and the requirement for competent professional services.","A professional engineer, like N.D.

They operated a resort lodge in Algonquin Park in the summer and lived in Toronto in the winter. Both parties worked in the business; the husband handled the finance and the wife the day-to-day operation of the lodge. When they separated in 1993, both parties were in their early 40s and all the children were under 8 years old. The wife wanted to stay home with the children given their ages. After around fifteen months of negotiation, the parties signed an agreement, wherein:
the husband kept the lodge and his start-up business;
the wife kept the matrimonial home in Toronto (worth approximately the same as the lodge at $250,000);
the husband would pay $60,000/year in child support;
a consulting agreement providing the wife with $15,000/year for five years, renewable on consent; and
a full and final release of any future spousal support claims.
After the divorce judgment was issued in 1997, the wife's childcare obligations changed and the consulting agreement was not renewed. She applied to the court for relief, including spousal support. The trial judge referred to the husband as ""manipulative"" and ""obsessive"". The application was allowed, child support was brought in line with the

representation by counsel: the degree of professional assistance received by the party is relevant, but a court should not presume an imbalance of power.

duration of negotiations: was the agreement negotiated over a reasonable amount of time?

Generally, where negotiation of the agreement was correct and the agreement remains in substantial compliance with the
Act
, the court should defer to the wishes of the party and accord the agreement great weight.
Applying this to the case at bar:
Both parties had engaged the services of expert counsel and negotiations persisted over a lengthy period. Although the husband may have been the dominant party, the wife had adequate counsel; there was no hint of any vulnerabilities that might not be compensated by counsel.
The quantum of child support established in the agreement intended to provide the wife with a minimum amount of income in contemplation of her not working. While the wife argues that the business generates income, this was accounted for when the assets were valued and divided. The consulting contract reflects the parties' intention to provide the wife with a source of employment income for a limited time. The wife chose not to go back to the workforce, and had substantial assets even without support; there was no hardship or long-term disadvantage.
In the result, the original order should stand.
LeBel and Deschamps, in the dissent, stress very different concepts: interdependence and unequal bargaining power.  They propose a simpler test; is the agreement objectively unfair when considered now?
The dissenters disagree with the majority in two key areas.  One, the presence of counsel may not be enough to negate a power imbalance, and two, that very little deference should be given to agreements that deviate from the objectives in
s. 15.2(6)
of the
Act

While in the 27th week of pregnancy she was driving her car when her negligent actions caused a car accident.  The fetus was permanently injured, and was born prematurely that day.  Her son, Ryan Dobson, suffered physical and mental injuries, including cerebral palsy.  His grandfather launched a tort claim for damages against his mother.  Ryan was successful at the Court of Appeal, which his mother appealed.",Should a mother be liable in tort for damages to her child arising from a prenatal negligent act that allegedly injured the fetus in her womb?,Appeal allowed.,"Cory, writing for the majority, finds that the mother should not be held liable in the situation because of the policy implications.  They employ the
Kamloops
test to determine if a duty of care should be owed.  It has two parts:
Is the relationship between the two parties close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there any public policy implications that should negate or limit the scope of the duty?
They find that the first part is satisfied; however the public policy implications negate the duty.  They state that there are two main reasons for this: it would violate the privacy and autonomy of women, and it is impossible to judicially define a reasonable standard of conduct for pregnant women.
McLachlin, in a concurring judgment, states that another main reason why this duty cannot be imposed is that it would violate pregnant women's rights under the
Charter
– specifically liberty and equality.  They would lose their liberty, and not be treated equally with other women in society.
Major, in the dissent, states that in order for the public policy implications to negate the duty they must add new restrictions on what the woman can do.  He says that this is not the case, because she had a duty of care to everyone else on the road, and extending that to the foetus would not change the reasonable standard of her conduct.  He says that this case deals specifically with pregnant women driving automobiles, and if the creation of duty imposed a limitation on her actions that was not there previously then the outcome would be different.  He uses the example with another pregnant woman in the car – if the same outcome occurred, then there is no question that the other woman's foetus could sue her for negligence.  He agrees that the
Kamloops
test applies, but says that the policy implications here do not negate the duty.","Pregnant women do not owe a duty of care to the foetus in their womb.

(However, three judges found that Aboriginal title existed and had not been extinguished, and three judges found it had been extinguished).","Although the case was decided on a procedural point, a significant portion of the court addressed the substantive issue. Three judges held that Aboriginal title existed as a legal right that survived the assertion of Crown sovereignty unless lawfully extinguished, based on Indigenous peoples' historical occupation and use of the land. They found it had not been extinguished in this case. Three other judges found that Aboriginal title had been extinguished by various legislative and governmental acts over time. The seventh judge died before judgment was rendered.","Aboriginal title is a legal right based on the historical occupation and use of land by Indigenous peoples that existed prior to the assertion of Crown sovereignty and continues to exist unless it has been lawfully extinguished.

They claim that the aboriginal title over a piece of land in British Columbia that had been present before Confederation had never been extinguished, and that the tribe therefore still had title to the land.  This claim was denied at trial and upheld at appeal.","Do the alleged aboriginal land claims exist?

The Supreme Court holds that aboriginal title definitely exists, however they were split over whether or not it had been extinguished.  The majority decided that it has been extinguished by virtue of the government's exercise of control over the lands, and therefore the appeal is dismissed.  However, the dissenting judges disagree and state that more must be present to prove that the lands were extinguished.  They say that the provincial government did not have any constitutional right to deal with the land of the aboriginals, and that their predecessors before confederation did not do anything that could amount to extinguishing the lands.","Recognition of aboriginal title.

(Mrs.) v Eve,"Mrs. E, the mother of Eve, a 24-year-old woman with significant intellectual disability functioning at the level of a young child, sought a court order authorizing the non-therapeutic sterilization of Eve. Eve was incapable of understanding pregnancy, childbirth, or child-rearing and required constant supervision. The mother's purpose was to prevent pregnancy, which she believed would be detrimental to Eve's well-being. There was no medical necessity for the procedure.","Does a court have the jurisdiction under its parens patriae power or otherwise to authorize the non-therapeutic sterilization of a mentally incompetent person solely for the benefit of that person (i.e., not for therapeutic reasons to preserve life or health)?",The Supreme Court of Canada unanimously held that courts do not have the jurisdiction to authorize the non-therapeutic sterilization of a mentally incompetent person. The mother's application was denied.,"The court emphasized the fundamental right to bodily integrity and personal autonomy, including reproductive rights. Sterilization is a grave and irreversible procedure with profound physical and psychological consequences. The court found no basis in common law or parens patriae jurisdiction for courts to authorize such a procedure for a non-therapeutic purpose. The 'best interests' test, while applicable to other medical treatments for incompetents, is not appropriate for non-therapeutic sterilization due to the fundamental rights involved and the potential for abuse. The court stated that only medical necessity (to save life or preserve health) might potentially justify such intervention, and even then, legislative authority with strict safeguards would likely be required, which was absent here. Non-therapeutic sterilization, in this context, was deemed a violation of the incompetent person's fundamental rights.","Courts in Canada do not possess common law or parens patriae jurisdiction to authorize the non-therapeutic sterilization of a mentally incompetent person. Non-therapeutic sterilization, carried out for reasons other than medical necessity to preserve life or health, is a violation of the incompetent person's fundamental right to bodily integrity and cannot be authorized by a court.","Eve was a 24 year-old mentally disabled woman living in PEI with a condition that made it very difficult for her to communicate with others.  She was sent away from her mother, who cared for her, during the week so that she could attend a special school.  Her mother was seeking the court's permission to perform a sterilization procedure (hysterectomy) on her daughter.  There was considerable evidence that the daughter would be incapable of handling the burdens of motherhood.  Eve had struck up a friendship with a boy from school, and discussed marriage, and her mother is afraid of the burden that would be placed on Eve, and ultimately upon herself to look after a child if pregnancy ensued.  Permission was denied at trial, but granted at the Court of Appeal.",Can a caregiver for someone incapable of giving informed consent make decisions about surgeries for the incapable individual?,Appeal allowed.,"La Forest, writing for a unanimous court, discusses the history of
parens patriae
jurisdiction, which states that the state is responsible for decisions concerning those that cannot give informed consent themselves. He says that the test is generally that the only procedures that will be allowed are ones that are in the ""best interests"" of the protected person. He focuses his criticism in this case on the fact that Mrs. E. is claiming that the burden on her to look after the child should be considered in making the decision. La Forest states that this should be given no consideration, as it is only the best interests of the protected person that are of concern.
He also says that arguing about the protected person's fitness as a parents involves value-loaded questions that result in a designation of disabled persons as less competent parents, even though there is significant evidence showing that they show as much fondness and concern for their children as anyone else. He also considers that the procedure of a hysterectomy is serious surgery and quite invasive, and further that Eve does not require assistance caring for her reproductive cycle, which is a concern in other cases. Perhaps most importantly, this surgery is not therapeutic.
La Forest concludes that ""the grave intrusion on a person’s rights and the certain physical damage that ensues from non-therapeutic sterilization without consent, when compared to the highly questionable advantages that can result, [show that] it can never safely be determined that such a procedure is for the benefit of the person."" The procedure should never be authorized for non-therapeutic purposes under the

GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,British Columbia v British Columbia Government Service Employees' Union (Re Meiorin),"Tawney Meiorin was a forest firefighter who successfully performed her job for several years. The BC government implemented new fitness standards for all forest firefighters, including an aerobic capacity test (VO2 max). Meiorin failed this aerobic test but passed all other components and was capable of performing her job duties. She was laid off because she failed the aerobic test. She grieved, arguing the standard was discriminatory based on sex, as women on average have lower aerobic capacity than men.","Was the aerobic fitness standard discriminatory on the basis of sex? If so, could the standard be justified as a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR) under the BC Human Rights Act?","Yes, the standard was discriminatory based on sex and was not a justifiable bona fide occupational requirement. The grievance was upheld, and Meiorin was ordered reinstated with back pay.","The Court found the standard was prima facie discriminatory because it had a disproportionately adverse impact on women. The Court established a new, unified three-part test for establishing a BFOR in discrimination cases under human rights legislation: 1) The employer adopted the standard for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job; 2) The employer adopted the standard in an honest belief that it was necessary to the fulfillment of that legitimate work-related purpose; and 3) The standard is reasonably necessary to accomplish that legitimate work-related purpose (meaning it is impossible to accommodate individuals sharing the claimant's characteristics without undue hardship). The employer failed the third part of the test because they did not prove the specific aerobic standard was reasonably necessary for safe and efficient work performance, nor did they demonstrate that accommodating individuals like Meiorin (who could perform the job despite failing the test) would cause undue hardship.","A prima facie discriminatory occupational standard can be justified as a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR) only if the employer proves, using a three-part test, that the standard is rationally connected to the job, honestly believed to be necessary, and reasonably necessary in that it is impossible to accommodate individual differences up to the point of undue hardship without sacrificing the legitimate work-related purpose.

The Court rejected a strict 'needs/means' test or a presumptive rule.","The framework for awarding retroactive child support involves considering the child's interests, the payor's ability to pay, the recipient's explanation for delay, and the payor's conduct (failure to disclose income being a significant factor). There is no presumptive rule, and the payor's failure to provide full and frank financial disclosure weighs heavily in favour of retroactivity.","Parents had three children in the course of their ten year common law relationship.  The father had sole interim custody after separation but then the parties entered into an informal shared custody arrangement where neither party paid support.  Three years later the mother brought an action in Alberta for retroactive and ongoing support.  The chambers judge awarded her prospective support but not retroactive.  The Court of Appeal allowed her appeal, but found no blameworthy conduct or willful failure to disclose on the part of the father.
Three children were born in the course of a common law relationship. After separation the children lived with the mother, and some months later the father paid $150 in child support pursuant to a maintenance agreement which was increased to $300/month following a consent order.  The mother brought an action for retroactive support.  The father had low income and high access costs and resisted the action.  The chambers judge held retroactive support would constitute hardship.
Parents married in 1984 and divorced in 1991. After separation the two children lived with their mother and a divorce judgment ordered the father to pay $700/month in child support.  In 2000 the mother signaled an intention to request increased support.  The father voluntarily increased his payments, but still below the table amount.  The mother was unaware that his income had increased dramatically as they lived in different cities.  At chambers, the judge granted her application for retroactive support based on the table amount, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal in a 2-1 judgment.
Parents divorced in 1996.  The children lived with the father, then one of the children moved to lived with the mother.  The father had a lot more income and the mother asked for an increase of support but the father rejected the request.  The mother was hesitant to take the case to court because earlier proceedings had caused a rift between the mother and children.  The chambers judge held that this was an appropriate circumstance for a retroactive award, and he calculated it from January 1, 2003 onward, to be paid in the amount of $500/month, as a ""reasonable compromise"" that best fit the situation of the parties.  The Court of Appeal upheld the decision.

To prevent liability for retroactive support, any changes in income should be reported to the custodial parent.  If this is not done and an application is brought to enforce a change, four factors should be analysed to see if retroactive support is warranted:
Undue delay: does the recipient have a reasonable excuse for not seeking support earlier?
Any voluntary, intentional choice not to apply for an increase will militate against retroactive support.  There is a balancing here; a child should not be punished for a poor choice of the parent.
Was there blameworthy conduct on the part of the payor?
This is interpreted broadly; anything that privileges the payor's interests over his/her children's right to an appropriate amount of support.
Could the payor have reasonably believed that they were discharging their support obligations?
The more significant a change in income, the more likely a court will find a payor's behaviour blameworthy if they do not proactively disclose.
Need of child/benefit: would the child benefit from retroactive award based on their needs/circumstances?
If a child's needs are being met by the current support, this will militate against a retroactive award.
Would a retroactive award cause hardship to payor?
This is a distinct element from the
s. 10
undue hardship test.
Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.

Turning to how far back retroactive payments should go, it turns on the conduct of the parents.  If there was no blameworthy behaviour, the retroactivity should go to when the custodial parent informs the payor that they are seeking additional support.  Generally there will be a limit of 3 years.  For blameworthy parents, the retroactivity should continue to when the support should have changed and did not, without limit.
As to the amount of a retroactive payment, the court should follow the
Guidelines
, but the court has broad discretion to craft a remedy that would be fair having regard to all the circumstances, including hardship on the payor.
Applying this to the cases...
This was an initial application for child support.  The parents had a shared custody arrangement that thought that meant no child support was payable (see
Contino v Leonelli-Contino
).  The incomes of the parents were relatively equal and due to the shared custody any money going to one household would simply be removed from the other.  Due to the lack of blameworthy conduct and the lack of benefit to the children, no retroactive support was awarded.
The father from whom support was being sought was low income (~$23,000/year) and he was supporting a second family.  Any retroactive award would cause his household hardship.  The access costs for him were also high.  Because of the lack of blameworthy conduct, the hardship a retroactive award would cause, and the fact that the standard of living in the custodial household was higher, no retroactive support was awarded.
In this case, the mother had broached the subject with the father but could not afford a lawyer to fight the case.  She was intimidated by her ex-husband and did not know much about his financial situation as he lived in another city.  The husband had had a huge income increase and held it from her, as well as saying that she should have managed her money better to better provide for their kids and that he was paying all he could afford.  Due to the large amount of blameworthy conduct and the large discrepancy in the amount he was paying and the table amount, the court awarded $100,000 in retroactive support.
As in
Henry
, the parties had very different incomes; the father earned more than $100,000K/year, much more than the mother, and he gave no financial support when the need arose.  The mother said she had not wanted to litigate because of the effect it had had on her daughter the last time they litigated.  The court held that the delay of mother was not unreasonable, and the father had no reasonable grounds on which to believe the level of support he was paying was reasonable, and thus the award granted at trial was upheld.
Abella, dissenting in part, had three issues with the decision of Bastarache.
The presumptive starting date of effective notice: the payor has the information on when their income changes, so it is impractical and unrealistic to expect the recipient to keep tabs on the payor’s income; the date should be when the income changes.
The role of blameworthy conduct: the conduct of the payor should be immaterial; the whole obligation depends on the income increase, conduct of the parties is irrelevant.
The three year cutoff: Abella finds this arbitrary - any cutoff of this type should be found in statute, not created by the courts.","Retroactive child support orders should no longer be rare or difficult to obtain.
Established the framework for assessing claims where there is a large, undisclosed swing in income.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?

GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,O'Grady v Sparling,"The defendant, Sparling, was charged under a Manitoba provincial statute for driving without due care and attention. He argued the provincial law was unconstitutional (ultra vires) because it encroached upon the federal power over criminal law, specifically the field occupied by the Criminal Code offence of dangerous driving.","Is a provincial law prohibiting driving without due care and attention constitutionally valid, or is it ultra vires the province for encroaching on the federal criminal law power regarding dangerous driving?",The Supreme Court of Canada held the provincial statute was constitutionally valid (intra vires).,"The Court applied the doctrine of double aspect, holding that the provincial law regulated highway traffic safety and civil conduct by punishing negligence, which falls under provincial jurisdiction (e.g., property and civil rights, local matters). The federal Criminal Code provision dealt with dangerous conduct constituting a crime, falling under federal criminal law power. The two laws addressed different aspects of the same conduct and were not in direct conflict; it was possible to comply with both. Therefore, the provincial law was a valid exercise of provincial power.","A provincial law regulating conduct related to highway traffic safety (e.g., driving without due care and attention) is constitutionally valid under provincial powers, even if similar conduct could also constitute a federal criminal offence (e.g., dangerous driving). The same conduct can have different constitutional aspects (provincial regulatory vs. federal criminal) and be subject to both levels of government's laws if there is no direct conflict.","O'Grady was charged under s. 55(1) of the Manitoba
Highway Traffic Act
(now
s. 188
) which prohibited driving ""on a highway without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway"".

s. 219
) of the
Criminal Code
, which prohibited driving with ""wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons"".  O'Grady was convicted at trial and an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba was dismissed.","Are provincial laws relating to negligence with penal consequences criminal law and therefore

He reaffirmed the principle that there exists a ""general area"" or ""domain"" of criminal law and the two governments can make law on the same matter by creating a distinction between the types of culpability.  He quotes from Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law:
There are only two states of mind which constitute
mens rea
, and they are intention and recklessness. The difference between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; they are opposed and it is a logical fallacy to suggest that recklessness is a degree of negligence. The common habit of lawyers to qualify the word ""negligence"" with some moral epithet such as ""wicked"", ""gross"", or ""culpable"" has been most unfortunate since it has inevitably led to great confusion of thought and of principle. It is equally misleading to speak of criminal negligence since this is merely to use an expression to explain itself.
On the facts, Judson found that there was overlap between the laws however ""there is no conflict between these provisions in the sense that they are repugnant"". The provincial law extended to include ""inadvertent negligence"" as well as regular negligence. It was enough that “the two pieces of legislation differed both in legislative purpose and legal and practical effect” to justify both of them.","The distinction between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; recklessness is when an actor does not desire harmful consequences but forsees the possibility and consciously takes the risk.

The Federal Court of Appeal overturned the Minister, finding financial support was not necessary. The Attorney General appealed.",Is financial support or interdependence a necessary element of a 'relationship of a conjugal nature' for the purpose of pension division under the Pension Benefits Division Act?,"The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal, overturning the Federal Court of Appeal and reinstating the Minister's decision.","The meaning of 'conjugal relationship' depends on the statutory context and purpose. Unlike support obligations, pension division aims to recognize contributions to the relationship, including financial ones. Financial support or interdependence is an essential characteristic of a conjugal relationship for the purpose of pension division legislation like the Pension Benefits Division Act. The Federal Court of Appeal erred by stating it was never a necessary element. The Minister's interpretation, requiring financial support in this context, was reasonable.","For the purposes of the Pension Benefits Division Act, a relationship of a conjugal nature requires proof of financial support or interdependence as an essential element.

The Superintendent of Motor Vehicles denied him a driver's license based on an 'Absolute Standard' policy (Circular 06/85) which prohibited licensing individuals with this condition, regardless of individual ability or compensatory strategies. Grismer filed a human rights complaint alleging discrimination based on disability.","Did the Superintendent's policy of denying driving licenses solely based on the diagnosis of homonymous hemianopia constitute discrimination based on disability under the BC Human Rights Act? If so, was the policy justifiable as a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR)?",The Supreme Court of Canada upheld the lower tribunal's decision that the Superintendent's policy was discriminatory and not a justifiable bona fide occupational requirement.,"The Court found that the policy was discriminatory on the basis of disability. Applying the three-part BFOR test from Meiorin, the Court held that while the objective (highway safety) and good faith requirements were met, the policy failed the third stage: reasonable necessity. The 'Absolute Standard' was not reasonably necessary because it was based on a blanket rule that failed to consider individual abilities or the possibility of accommodation (such as compensatory strategies or alternative testing methods) without undue hardship. Less discriminatory alternatives existed.","To justify prima facie discrimination based on disability as a bona fide requirement under human rights legislation, the decision-maker must demonstrate that the standard is reasonably necessary and that individual accommodation, short of undue hardship, is not possible.

test, showing that it can be used in scenarios outside of the workplace to determine if discrimination is justified.  This case passes the first part because the purpose of the standard (reasonable safety) is rationally connected to the function (issuing drivers’ licenses).  It also passes the second step because there is no evidence that the standard (no licenses for HH sufferers) was adopted for any reasons other than road safety.  However the case fails the third step as the court finds that the standard (no licenses for HH) is not reasonably necessary for the purpose (reasonable safety).  The blanket prohibition doesn't let people even attempt to show that they can drive safely.
It is clear here that the accommodation would be to allow testing.  In order to succeed the government would have had to prove that to allow testing would result to undue hardship which they failed to do.  Although there are clearly safety and cost concerns involved with testing, the government didn't put in any effort to determine these values, nor did they even look for alternative ways of testing.  The court also says that in general, with the government, costs must be exorbitant to amount to undue hardship, as they are publicly funded and this would be seen as being in the public interest.  As the standard is not rationally necessary for the purpose of reasonable road safety, it amounts to discrimination and must be removed.","The
Meiorin
test applies to all standards that are thought to be discriminatory, even if they do not occur in a workplace; called bona fide justification tests.
The government will be held to a very high threshold when claiming that the costs of not adopting a standard amount to undue hardship as they are publicly funded and preventing discrimination is in the public interest."
GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,Just v British Columbia,"The plaintiff was injured when rocks fell from a cut bank onto a highway maintained by the defendant province. The plaintiff alleged the province was negligent in inspecting and maintaining the slope. The trial judge found the province negligent. The Court of Appeal overturned, holding that decisions regarding the standard of highway maintenance were policy decisions immune from liability. The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.","Does the government owe a duty of care in making decisions about the standard and method of road maintenance (specifically, inspection and repair of slopes adjacent to highways), or are such decisions purely policy matters immune from negligence claims?",Appeal allowed. The province owed a duty of care.,"The Court distinguished between policy decisions (high-level, discretionary choices about whether or at what level to provide a service) and operational decisions (decisions made in the implementation of a policy). While true policy decisions are often immune from liability, operational decisions made in the execution of a policy (like maintaining roads) are subject to a duty of care. The province had a policy to maintain highways. Decisions concerning the standard and method of inspection and maintenance of slopes adjacent to the highway were operational decisions, attracting a duty of care to highway users. The government could be held liable for negligence in carrying out these operational tasks below a reasonable standard.","While governmental decisions regarding the initial provision or general level of a service may constitute non-justiciable policy decisions immune from negligence, decisions concerning the operational implementation of a service or policy, including the standard and method of maintenance of public infrastructure, are subject to a private law duty of care owed to affected individuals. The 'policy/operational' distinction is central to determining governmental liability in negligence.","Heavy snow fall forced Just and his daughter to stop in a line of traffic by a rocky slope on a major highway.  A boulder, which worked loose from the wooded slopes above the highway, came crashing down on the appellant's car, killing the appellant's daughter and causing him very serious injuries.  Just brought an action against the provincial government contending that the government negligently failed to properly maintain the highway.
The Department of Highways had set up a system for inspection and remedial work upon rock slopes.  Inspection and recommendations were made by engineers and the work was effected by a rock scaling crew responsible for performing remedial work throughout the entire province.  The department's practice had been to make visual inspections from the highway unless rock falls or a history of instability in an area indicated a need for the rock engineer to climb the slope.  Numerous informal inspections were carried out by highway personnel as they drove along the road.
The trial judge found that the entire system of inspection and the way it was implemented was a policy matter which did not give rise to liability. No finding was made as to whether or not the system of inspection was reasonable or whether the inspections themselves were properly carried out. The Court of Appeal upheld the finding of the trial judge and Just appealled to the Supreme Court.","Is the government under a duty of care to maintain the highways and if so, are they liable if the highways are not sufficiently maintained?","Appeal allowed, new trial ordered.","Cory, writing for the majority, held that the province owes a duty of care, which ordinarily extends to their reasonable maintenance, to those using its highways.  The Department of Highways could readily foresee the risk that harm might befall users of a highway if it were not reasonably maintained.  That maintenance could be found to extend to the prevention of injury from falling rock.
Government agencies may be exempt from the application of the traditional tort law duty of care if an explicit statutory exemption exists or if the decision arose as a result of a policy decision.  Whether or not a decision is characterized as a policy decision or as an operational decision rests on the nature of the decision and not on the identity of the actors.  Generally, decisions concerning budgetary allotments for departments or government agencies should be classified as policy decisions.  A policy decision may be open to challenge on the basis that it is not made in the bona fide exercise of discretion.  If after due consideration it is found that a duty of care is owed by the government agency and no exemption by way of statute or policy decision-making is found to exist, a traditional torts analysis ensues (as per
Anns v Merton London Borough Council
) and the issue of standard of care required of the government agency must next be considered.  The manner and quality of an inspection system, since it was clearly part of the operational aspect of a governmental activity, should be assessed when consideration is given to the standard of care issue.  At this stage, the requisite standard of care must be assessed in light of all the surrounding circumstances including budgetary restraints and the availability of qualified personnel and equipment.
Sopinka, in the dissent, held that the government had the power to carry out the inspections but was under no duty to do so.  Conduct within the limits of this discretion gives rise to no duty of care; conduct outside of these limits may attract a private law duty of care.
A litigant may not attack a policy and it is not appropriate for a Court to pass on it, absent evidence that a policy was adopted for some ulterior motive and not for a municipal purpose.  In order for a private duty to arise, it would have to be shown that the Rockwork Section acted outside its delegated discretion to determine whether to inspect and the manner in which the inspection is to be made.  Policy decisions are immune from review because they usually entail not only a decision to do something but also some call upon the public purse.  The government was acting within its discretion when it decided that inspections should be done and the manner in which they were to be done.  Responsibility for deciding the extent to which the inspection program was to be implemented was delegated to the Rockwork Section.","The duty of care should apply to a public authority unless there is a valid basis for its exclusion.
Policy decisions – the decision by the government about what acts to perform under a given statute – are exempt from liability; operational decisions – the decision by the government about how to perform those acts once they have been decided - are not exempt from liability."
GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,Machtinger v HOJ Industries Ltd.,"The plaintiffs, Machtinger and Lefebvre, were employees of HOJ Industries Ltd. Their employment contracts contained clauses specifying notice periods upon termination without cause (e.g., 0-4 weeks depending on length of service), which were less than the minimum notice periods required by the Ontario Employment Standards Act (ESA). HOJ Industries terminated their employment without cause and provided only the contractual notice or pay in lieu, which was less than both the ESA minimum and common law reasonable notice. The ESA states that a contract providing less than the minimum notice is void.","Where an employment contract specifies a period of notice upon termination without cause that is less than the minimum period required by provincial employment standards legislation, is the employee entitled only to the statutory minimum notice, or is the invalid contractual provision void, thereby entitling the employee to reasonable notice at common law?","The Supreme Court of Canada held that the contractual notice provisions were void because they contravened the ESA. As a result, the employees were entitled to reasonable notice of termination at common law, not merely the statutory minimum notice period.","The Court reasoned that the ESA sets minimum standards and invalidates any term of an employment contract that attempts to provide a lesser benefit. A contractual notice provision providing less than the statutory minimum is void. When the notice provision in a contract is void, there is effectively no valid contractual term addressing notice upon termination. In the absence of a valid contractual notice provision displacing the common law presumption, the common law rule that employment is terminable only on reasonable notice applies. The ESA minimum notice does not automatically replace the void term; rather, the absence of a valid term triggers the common law right to reasonable notice.","An employment contract term providing for termination notice shorter than the minimum required by applicable employment standards legislation is void for contravening the statute. When a contractual notice provision is void, the common law presumption that employment is terminable only on reasonable notice applies, entitling the employee to reasonable notice at common law, not merely the statutory minimum notice.","Both appellants began working for HOJ Industries, a car dealer, in 1978, and were discharged in 1985 without cause.  At the time they were dismissed Machtinger was credit manager and rust‑proofing sales manager and Lefebvre was sales manager.  Each had entered into a contract for employment for an indefinite period which contained a clause allowing the respondent to terminate his employment without cause, in Machtinger's case without notice and in Lefebvre's case on two weeks' notice.  Under the provincial
Employment Standards Act
the appellants were entitled to a minimum notice period of four weeks.  After they were dismissed, the respondent paid each of them the equivalent of four weeks' salary.  The appellants brought action for wrongful dismissal and the trial judge found that they were entitled to reasonable notice of termination, and that the period of reasonable notice for Machtinger was 7 months and for Lefebvre, 7½ months, however this was overturned by the Court of Appeal.",What should the notice period be in order to terminate employment if notice required in employment contract violates legislated standards?,"Appeal allowed, lower court judgment restored.","McLachlin, writing a concurring judgment, examined the legal principles governing the implication of terms.  She identifies three types of implied terms:
terms implied by fact (intention required);
terms implied by law (no intention required); and
terms implied by custom and usage,
and identifies #2 as the type the courts will read into a contract.  Implication of law can be from custom, for business efficiency (what is necessary in a contract), or what is reasonable (from Denning's dissent in
Liverpool City Council v Irwin
).
She finds that the Court of Appeal erred in characterizing a term implied in law as a term implied in fact, which brought in the intentionality of the parties.  Holding that the employer had a legal obligation to provide reasonable notice and that this can only be displaced by an express contrary agreement, the court imposed a reasonable term of notification on HOJ; HOJ industries.","Terms can be implied by the court based on:
custom or usage;
if necessary for business efficacy;

GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,Homex Realty and Development Co. Ltd. v Wyoming (Village),"Homex Realty, a developer, had obtained draft plan approval from the Ontario Municipal Board for a subdivision in the Village of Wyoming. Despite this approval, the Village council refused to issue building permits and subsequently passed a by-law that purported to revoke the draft plan approval and impose new conditions, solely to frustrate the development. Homex sued the Village for mandamus to compel the issuance of permits and for damages for misfeasance in public office.","Did the Village council act maliciously and in bad faith in refusing building permits and passing a by-law to frustrate the development, thereby committing misfeasance in public office for which Homex could recover damages?",Yes. The Supreme Court of Canada held that the Village council had acted maliciously and in bad faith and confirmed the award of damages to Homex for misfeasance in public office.,"The Court found that the council's actions were not a legitimate exercise of their statutory powers but were taken for the improper purpose of preventing the development due to local opposition, in disregard of Homex's legal rights established by the OMB approval. This deliberate misuse of power for an improper purpose constituted misfeasance in public office.","Misfeasance in public office occurs when a public official deliberately abuses power for an improper purpose or acts maliciously, causing damage to a private party. A municipal council's politically motivated actions taken in bad faith to frustrate a developer's lawful rights, including refusing building permits based on an invalid by-law intended solely to prevent development, constitute misfeasance in public office, for which damages are recoverable.","As a condition of registration of a plan of subdivision in the Village of Wyoming, Atkinson, the owner and subdivider of the parcel of land, entered into an agreement with the Village for the installation of municipal services in the subdivision. This agreement, dated January 22, 1968, and registered September 26, 1975, provided in a general way for the owner's providing ""all the requirements financial and otherwise, of the Corporation re surfacing of roads, installation of services and drainage"". The agreement also prevented the sale of the lands in question until the agreement had been fully carried out, except with the consent of the Village, but the provision did not provide that consent would operate to release Atkinson from his obligation to the Village. Before any services were installed, Homex bought the great majority of the lots on the subdivision with the Village's consent. There was some question as to whether or not Homex had undertaken to assume the obligations of the original subdivider. Nevertheless, when protracted negotiations between the Village and Homex concerning the installation of services proved fruitless, the Village, in April 1976, pursuant to s. 29(3) (now
s. 50(3)
) of the
Planning Act
and without notice to Homex, enacted by-law 7 deeming the lots purchased by Homex not to be a registered plan of subdivision. Homex, in September 1976, made application for judicial review for an order quashing by-law 7 and, while the application was pending, checkerboarded its lots.
In November 1975, Homex and the Village negotiated the installation of services along the only street requiring them. By-law 6, enacted in December 1975, provided that it was the policy of the Village that it would neither assume responsibility for a water pipeline constructed by Homex nor permit its connection to the municipal water supply system. Homex coupled an application in judicial review to quash by-law 6 with the application for an order to quash by-law 7.","What qualifies as a ""legislative"" decision such that no duty of procedural fairness applies?",Appeal dismissed.,"Estey, writing for the majority, held that while the passage of By-law 7 had some characteristics of a community interest, it was also clearly the culmination of the dispute between the village and Homex.  As a result he found that the decision was quasi-judicial such as to attract the principle of notice and the doctrine of
audi alteram partem
.  Despite this, however, he held that the conduct of Homex to rid itself of the obligations under the agreement with Atkinson were such that it should be denied a discretionary remedy.  There was also no basis to challenge By-law 6 as it simply stated the facts of the agreement with Atkinson.
Dickson, in the dissent, is quoted:
The courts long ago developed the general proposition that wherever a statute authorizes the interference with property or other rights and is silent as to whether or not the agency in question is required to give notice prior to the intervention in such rights, the courts will ""supply the omission of the legislature"" and require the agency in question to afford the subject an opportunity of being heard before it proceeds.
He held that an act could not be labelled ""legislative"" merely for the purpose of dispensing with fairness. It was not particularly important that the function of the municipality was classified as ""legislative"" or ""quasi-judicial"", rather, it was necessary to look at the nature of the function and to the facts of each case. The by-law in question was not of wide and general application, but was rather aimed at deliberately limiting the rights of Homex, entitling it to some procedural safeguards - at a minimum, notice of the proposed by-law and the opportunity to be heard.","In general, the courts have not imposed procedural requirements on the subordinate law-making function.
The facts of each case are key to determining the level of procedural fairness required."
GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,Bell Canada v Canadian Telephone Employees Association,"Bell Canada introduced a computerized billing system, altering the duties and classifications of employees represented by the Canadian Telephone Employees Association. The union argued this constituted 'technological change' under the Canada Labour Code, Part V, requiring 90 days' notice and negotiation. Bell Canada contended it was merely a change in work methods not falling under the definition of 'technological change' requiring notice. No employees were laid off as a result of the change.","Did the introduction of a computerized billing system by Bell Canada, which changed employee duties and classifications but did not result in layoffs, constitute 'technological change' under the Canada Labour Code, Part V, triggering the requirement for notice to the union?",The Supreme Court of Canada held that the changes introduced by Bell Canada did not constitute 'technological change' within the meaning of the relevant provision of the Canada Labour Code requiring notice.,"The Court interpreted 'technological change' under the Canada Labour Code as primarily concerned with changes resulting from new equipment or machinery that significantly impact job security or the number of employees required. While duties changed, the absence of layoffs or fundamental alteration to job security meant the change did not fit the scope of 'technological change' intended by the notice provisions, which aimed to address disruptions to employment levels and terms caused by technology. The changes were viewed as incremental rather than fundamentally disruptive to employment security in the manner contemplated by the Act.","For a change to constitute 'technological change' triggering notice requirements under the Canada Labour Code (as it was then), it must be a change resulting from new equipment or machinery that significantly impacts the number of employees required or fundamentally alters their job security or terms of employment. Changes to duties or work methods that do not result in job loss or significant negative impact on employment security do not necessarily fall under this definition.","This is an appeal of the decision in

They claim that this constitutes a conflict of interest and a lack of necessary ""judicial"" independence.",Does the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal lack independence and impartiality because of the power of the Canadian Human Rights Commission to issue binding guidelines for them before they appear in front of them?,"Appeal dismissed, case to proceed to Tribunal.","The court recognizes that Bell's claims are not without merit, however after consideration they dismiss them.  The court held that Bell did not provide sufficient evidence for their claims and also because they misunderstand impartiality - it does not mean having the freedom to decide a case however one wishes to, being subject to certain binding principles is perfectly legitimate for an impartial judiciary.  Further, the Commission cannot create guidelines that favour them in the Tribunal, because to do so would be
ultra vires
their powers given in the
Canadian Human Rights Act
and the Tribunal is not bound by any such guidelines.  The powers that the Commission has to enact guidelines under

GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,Catholic Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto v CM,"The Catholic Children's Aid Society of Toronto sought to bring a 16-year-old child, CM, into care due to neglect and risks of exploitation. The case raised the question of whether the Child, Youth and Family Services Act of Ontario permits child protection applications for 16 and 17-year-old children.","Does the Child, Youth and Family Services Act of Ontario permit child protection applications for children aged 16 and 17?","Yes, the Child, Youth and Family Services Act permits child protection applications for 16 and 17-year-olds. The appeal by the CCAS was allowed.","The Supreme Court of Canada interpreted the definition of 'child' in the Act (under 18 years) in the broader context and purpose of the legislation. Examining other provisions concerning services for and continuation of care for 16 and 17-year-olds, the Court found clear legislative intent to include this age group within the child protection framework. The Act must be read consistently with the principle that 16 and 17-year-olds are children requiring protection.","Under the Child, Youth and Family Services Act of Ontario, the definition of 'child' for child protection purposes includes 16 and 17-year-olds. This interpretation is derived from reading the Act's provisions holistically, demonstrating legislative intent to protect this age group.","The aid society took SM into protection on several occasions and supervised her mother, CM, on parenting skills. On consent, SM was made a ward of the society 1989. Throughout the wardship, the society continued to work with CM and facilitated regular visits with SM, however, bonding between mother and daughter remained minimal. In December 1989, after a second four-month wardship, the society brought a status review application seeking an order of Crown wardship without access for the purposes of adoption. CM opposed the motion and the matter was dealt with sporadically throughout 1991. In February 1992 the Ontario Provincial Court ordered that SM be returned to CM on the basis that court intervention was no longer necessary to protect the child. The judge considered CM capable of acquiring the skill to care for her daughter adequately. The society obtained a stay of the order and unsuccessfully appealed to the Ontario Court (General Division). The Court of Appeal granted a stay of the order for return pending appeal and a motion for the introduction of fresh evidence. The new evidence concerned the consistent and repeated assertions of the child that she regarded her foster family as her real family, that she did not want to see her birth mother and that attempts to implement access visits with CM had become almost impossible because of the child's negative reactions - emotional, psychological and physical.  It allowed the appeal, set aside the order for the return of the child to the mother and ordered that the child be made a Crown ward without access for the purposes of adoption. CM appealed to the Supreme Court.",Does the child need continued protection?,Appeal dismissed.,"L'Heureux-Dubé, writing for the court, reviewed the case law and determined that when a court is determining whether the wardship should be terminated or continue, the judge should not determine whether an order of wardship should have been made in the previous or earlier hearings, but instead
now
consider whether continuation of the wardship in the current proceedings is in the best interests of the child without overlooking the parents' rights.  The review hearing is not about retrying the original need for a protection order, but rather the court should determine the circumstances of the parents or parent since the last order as it relates to the situation with respect to the child's custody, including their physical, mental and emotional state since that time and also whether there is now a lifestyle, including attitudes of the parent, that warrants the child being returned to the parent or to wardship.
She lays out a two part test:
Does the child continue to need protection and require a court order for protection?
The children's aid society must continue to justify its intervention by showing that a court order is necessary to protect the child in the future.  This does not mean that an absence of proof of a deficiency in the parent's parenting capacity is enough to return the child to the parent.  A court order may be necessary to protect the child from emotional harm which would result in future if the child were taken from its psychological parents.
What is in the best interests of the children?
This should be decided through a balancing of the considerations such as the importance of the continuity of care, the child’s physical/emotional/psychological needs, the benefit of a child's bond to his/her biological parent, as well as psychological bonding of child to his/her foster family.
The furtherance and protection of the child’s best interests must take priority over the desires and interests of the parent.
The question is not merely whether the parent has seen the light and is now prepared to be a good parent, but whether or not the parent has, in factk turned a new leaf and whether he or she is now able to give to the children the care they require?

Stage 1 examines the circumstances surrounding the negotiation and execution of the agreement (procedural fairness, including absence of oppression, duress, full disclosure, and independent legal advice). Stage 2 examines the substance of the agreement at the time of the spousal support application, considering whether it is in substantial compliance with the objectives of the Divorce Act for spousal support (particularly regarding compensation, need, self-sufficiency, and consequences of the relationship breakdown). The court emphasized respecting contractual autonomy but allowing intervention if the agreement fails the test at either stage. In this case, the agreement passed Stage 1. At Stage 2, while circumstances had changed, the agreement was largely consistent with the objectives, warranting only limited, temporary support due to significant unanticipated hardship directly linked to the marriage.","Domestic contracts concerning spousal support are reviewed under a two-stage test: first, examining the procedural fairness of the agreement's formation (absence of vitiating factors, disclosure, advice); second, assessing the substantive fairness of the agreement's impact at the time of breakdown against the objectives of the Divorce Act's spousal support provisions. Courts should respect contractual autonomy but retain the ability to intervene if the agreement does not substantially comply with the Act's objectives at the time of the application.","The parties were married for 14 years and had four children.

duration of negotiations: was the agreement negotiated over a reasonable amount of time?
The analysis should not be restricted to the spousal support component – look at the whole agreement; the agreement as a whole should substantially comply with the factors and objectives of the
Act
(including the principles of certainty, autonomy and finality).
An agreement can be modified to bring it in line with the principles in the
Act
.
Foreseeability is interpreted broadly; circumstances do not have to have been explicitly considered/contemplated
Foreseeable circumstances include a change of job, assets going down in value, etc.
Foreseeable circumstances include a change of job, assets going down in value, etc.
Generally, where negotiation of the agreement was correct and the agreement remains in substantial compliance with the
Act
, the court should defer to the wishes of the party and accord the agreement great weight.
Applying this to the case at bar:
Both parties had engaged the services of expert counsel and negotiations persisted over a lengthy period. Although the husband may have been the dominant party, the wife had adequate counsel; there was no hint of any vulnerabilities that might not be compensated by counsel.
The quantum of child support established in the agreement intended to provide the wife with a minimum amount of income in contemplation of her not working. While the wife argues that the business generates income, this was accounted for when the assets were valued and divided. The consulting contract reflects the parties' intention to provide the wife with a source of employment income for a limited time. The wife chose not to go back to the workforce, and had substantial assets even without support; there was no hardship or long-term disadvantage.
In the result, the original order should stand.
LeBel and Deschamps, in the dissent, stress very different concepts: interdependence and unequal bargaining power.  They propose a simpler test; is the agreement objectively unfair when considered now?
The dissenters disagree with the majority in two key areas.  One, the presence of counsel may not be enough to negate a power imbalance, and two, that very little deference should be given to agreements that deviate from the objectives in
s. 15.2(6)
of the
Act
; any fair agreement should reasonably realize the four stated objectives.","Establishes the test for enforcement of support agreements.
Miglin
applies only to final spousal support agreements.  A final agreement is one which limits the amount or duration of support or waives support entirely; it does not contemplate variation."
GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,Dobson v Dobson,"A pregnant woman, Cynthia Dobson, was driving when she lost control of her vehicle and crashed. Her child, Ryan Dobson, was born prematurely via Caesarean section later that day and suffered injuries, including cerebral palsy, allegedly as a result of the accident while he was in utero. The child, through his father acting as guardian ad litem, sued his mother for negligence.",Can a child born alive sue his mother for injuries sustained in utero as a result of the mother's alleged negligence? Does a pregnant woman owe a legal duty of care to her unborn child?,The Supreme Court of Canada held that a pregnant woman does not owe a legal duty of care to her unborn child in tort that would give rise to a claim for negligence after the child is born. The lawsuit was dismissed.,"The Court considered the unique physiological relationship between a pregnant woman and her fetus and concluded that establishing a legal duty of care enforceable in tort would raise significant public policy concerns and intrude unduly on the pregnant woman's autonomy and bodily integrity. It would subject a pregnant woman's lifestyle and choices during pregnancy to judicial scrutiny and potential liability, which is not supported by existing tort principles or policy. The Court found no basis in common law, statute, or policy to create such a duty and liability in tort against the mother.","A pregnant woman does not owe a legal duty of care to her unborn child that is actionable in tort, and therefore a child born alive cannot sue his mother for injuries sustained in utero allegedly due to the mother's negligence.","Cynthia Dobson was a pregnant woman.  While in the 27th week of pregnancy she was driving her car when her negligent actions caused a car accident.  The fetus was permanently injured, and was born prematurely that day.  Her son, Ryan Dobson, suffered physical and mental injuries, including cerebral palsy.  His grandfather launched a tort claim for damages against his mother.  Ryan was successful at the Court of Appeal, which his mother appealed.",Should a mother be liable in tort for damages to her child arising from a prenatal negligent act that allegedly injured the fetus in her womb?,Appeal allowed.,"Cory, writing for the majority, finds that the mother should not be held liable in the situation because of the policy implications.  They employ the
Kamloops
test to determine if a duty of care should be owed.  It has two parts:
Is the relationship between the two parties close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there any public policy implications that should negate or limit the scope of the duty?
They find that the first part is satisfied; however the public policy implications negate the duty.  They state that there are two main reasons for this: it would violate the privacy and autonomy of women, and it is impossible to judicially define a reasonable standard of conduct for pregnant women.
McLachlin, in a concurring judgment, states that another main reason why this duty cannot be imposed is that it would violate pregnant women's rights under the
Charter
– specifically liberty and equality.  They would lose their liberty, and not be treated equally with other women in society.
Major, in the dissent, states that in order for the public policy implications to negate the duty they must add new restrictions on what the woman can do.  He says that this is not the case, because she had a duty of care to everyone else on the road, and extending that to the foetus would not change the reasonable standard of her conduct.  He says that this case deals specifically with pregnant women driving automobiles, and if the creation of duty imposed a limitation on her actions that was not there previously then the outcome would be different.  He uses the example with another pregnant woman in the car – if the same outcome occurred, then there is no question that the other woman's foetus could sue her for negligence.  He agrees that the
Kamloops
test applies, but says that the policy implications here do not negate the duty.","Pregnant women do not owe a duty of care to the foetus in their womb.
The test to determine if a duty of care is owed has two parts:
Is the relationship close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there public policy grounds to negate or limit the scope of the duty?
