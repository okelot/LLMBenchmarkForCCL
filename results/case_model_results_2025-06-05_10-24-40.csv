The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Nisga'a had a right to occupy their lands and that the Crown's actions in issuing permits and licenses to log and mine the lands were unlawful.","Did the Nisga'a have title to their traditional lands, and if so, had such title been extinguished by the Crown?","The Supreme Court of Canada held that the Nisga'a did have title to their traditional lands, but that such title had been extinguished by the Crown prior to the issuance of permits and licenses to log and mine the lands. However, the Court also held that the Nisga'a had a right to compensation for the loss of their lands.","The Court held that the Nisga'a had title to their traditional lands based on their historical occupation and use of the lands. However, the Court also found that the Crown had extinguished the Nisga'a title through a series of legislative and administrative actions, including the establishment of the Colony of British Columbia and the issuance of permits and licenses to log and mine the lands.","The ratio decidendi of the case is that Indigenous title to traditional lands can be established through historical occupation and use, but that such title can be extinguished by the Crown through clear and plain legislative or administrative action.","The appellants are representative of the Nishga Tribe of British Columbia.  They claim that the aboriginal title over a piece of land in British Columbia that had been present before Confederation had never been extinguished, and that the tribe therefore still had title to the land.  This claim was denied at trial and upheld at appeal.","Do the alleged aboriginal land claims exist?
If the claims exist, were they extinguished?",Appeal dismissed.,"At trial and upon initial appeal the courts decided that if there ever was aboriginal title, it was surely extinguished upon confederation.  The Supreme Court holds that aboriginal title definitely exists, however they were split over whether or not it had been extinguished.  The majority decided that it has been extinguished by virtue of the government's exercise of control over the lands, and therefore the appeal is dismissed.  However, the dissenting judges disagree and state that more must be present to prove that the lands were extinguished.  They say that the provincial government did not have any constitutional right to deal with the land of the aboriginals, and that their predecessors before confederation did not do anything that could amount to extinguishing the lands.","Recognition of aboriginal title.

The court also emphasized the importance of protecting the rights and autonomy of individuals with disabilities.","The court established that non-therapeutic sterilization of a mentally disabled person without their consent is not in their best interests and is a violation of their rights to autonomy, dignity, and bodily integrity.","Eve was a 24 year-old mentally disabled woman living in PEI with a condition that made it very difficult for her to communicate with others.  She was sent away from her mother, who cared for her, during the week so that she could attend a special school.  Her mother was seeking the court's permission to perform a sterilization procedure (hysterectomy) on her daughter.  There was considerable evidence that the daughter would be incapable of handling the burdens of motherhood.  Eve had struck up a friendship with a boy from school, and discussed marriage, and her mother is afraid of the burden that would be placed on Eve, and ultimately upon herself to look after a child if pregnancy ensued.  Permission was denied at trial, but granted at the Court of Appeal.",Can a caregiver for someone incapable of giving informed consent make decisions about surgeries for the incapable individual?,Appeal allowed.,"La Forest, writing for a unanimous court, discusses the history of
parens patriae
jurisdiction, which states that the state is responsible for decisions concerning those that cannot give informed consent themselves. He says that the test is generally that the only procedures that will be allowed are ones that are in the ""best interests"" of the protected person. He focuses his criticism in this case on the fact that Mrs. E. is claiming that the burden on her to look after the child should be considered in making the decision. La Forest states that this should be given no consideration, as it is only the best interests of the protected person that are of concern.
He also says that arguing about the protected person's fitness as a parents involves value-loaded questions that result in a designation of disabled persons as less competent parents, even though there is significant evidence showing that they show as much fondness and concern for their children as anyone else. He also considers that the procedure of a hysterectomy is serious surgery and quite invasive, and further that Eve does not require assistance caring for her reproductive cycle, which is a concern in other cases. Perhaps most importantly, this surgery is not therapeutic.
La Forest concludes that ""the grave intrusion on a person’s rights and the certain physical damage that ensues from non-therapeutic sterilization without consent, when compared to the highly questionable advantages that can result, [show that] it can never safely be determined that such a procedure is for the benefit of the person."" The procedure should never be authorized for non-therapeutic purposes under the
parens patriae
jurisdiction.","Non-therapeutic surgeries can never be determined to be for the benefit of a person who is incapable of giving informed consent.
It is only the best interests of the disabled person concerned that are of importance; concerns of others should not be considered."

He filed a complaint with the Council of Human Rights alleging discrimination based on his disability.,Whether the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles' decision to deny Grismer a driver's license constituted discrimination under the Human Rights Code.,The court held that the Superintendent's decision was discriminatory and that Grismer's rights under the Human Rights Code had been infringed.,The court found that the Superintendent had not established that the visual standards for obtaining a driver's license were a bona fide occupational requirement. The court also found that the Superintendent had not provided sufficient evidence to justify the denial of Grismer's license application.,The decision established that a service provider must provide reasonable accommodation to individuals with disabilities unless it can be shown that doing so would cause undue hardship.,"The Government of British Columbia had a policy stating that it would not issue licenses to people suffering from a condition (homonymous hemianopsia (HH)) which affected eyesight.  The claimant had this condition but had driven flawlessly at work and on public roads using ""prism glasses"".  Despite this he was refused individual assessment and was not allowed to receive a license and was therefore unable to complete his job.  The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal allowed Grismer to be individually tested.  Grismer died shortly after this decision.  This was upheld by the British Columbia Supreme Court but overruled by the Court of Appeal.",Does an absolute prohibition on licensing people with a visual impairment without the possibility of individual assessment constitute discrimination?,"Appeal allowed, standard disallowed.","The court applies the
Meiorin
test, showing that it can be used in scenarios outside of the workplace to determine if discrimination is justified.  This case passes the first part because the purpose of the standard (reasonable safety) is rationally connected to the function (issuing drivers’ licenses).  It also passes the second step because there is no evidence that the standard (no licenses for HH sufferers) was adopted for any reasons other than road safety.  However the case fails the third step as the court finds that the standard (no licenses for HH) is not reasonably necessary for the purpose (reasonable safety).  The blanket prohibition doesn't let people even attempt to show that they can drive safely.
It is clear here that the accommodation would be to allow testing.  In order to succeed the government would have had to prove that to allow testing would result to undue hardship which they failed to do.  Although there are clearly safety and cost concerns involved with testing, the government didn't put in any effort to determine these values, nor did they even look for alternative ways of testing.  The court also says that in general, with the government, costs must be exorbitant to amount to undue hardship, as they are publicly funded and this would be seen as being in the public interest.  As the standard is not rationally necessary for the purpose of reasonable road safety, it amounts to discrimination and must be removed.","The
Meiorin
test applies to all standards that are thought to be discriminatory, even if they do not occur in a workplace; called bona fide justification tests.
The government will be held to a very high threshold when claiming that the costs of not adopting a standard amount to undue hardship as they are publicly funded and preventing discrimination is in the public interest."

His employment contract included a clause that limited his entitlement to notice of termination to the minimum required by the Employment Standards Act (ESA). When Machtinger was terminated, he received the minimum notice required by the ESA, but he claimed that he was entitled to reasonable notice at common law.","Was the termination clause in Machtinger's employment contract enforceable, or was he entitled to reasonable notice at common law?","The Supreme Court of Canada held that the termination clause was not enforceable, and Machtinger was entitled to reasonable notice at common law.","The court found that the termination clause was ambiguous and did not clearly exclude Machtinger's entitlement to reasonable notice at common law. The court also held that the ESA was intended to provide a minimum standard for employment contracts, and that employers could not contract out of the requirement to provide reasonable notice.","An employment contract must clearly and unambiguously exclude an employee's entitlement to reasonable notice at common law in order to be enforceable. If the contract is ambiguous, the employee will be entitled to reasonable notice at common law.","Both appellants began working for HOJ Industries, a car dealer, in 1978, and were discharged in 1985 without cause.  At the time they were dismissed Machtinger was credit manager and rust‑proofing sales manager and Lefebvre was sales manager.  Each had entered into a contract for employment for an indefinite period which contained a clause allowing the respondent to terminate his employment without cause, in Machtinger's case without notice and in Lefebvre's case on two weeks' notice.  Under the provincial
Employment Standards Act
the appellants were entitled to a minimum notice period of four weeks.  After they were dismissed, the respondent paid each of them the equivalent of four weeks' salary.  The appellants brought action for wrongful dismissal and the trial judge found that they were entitled to reasonable notice of termination, and that the period of reasonable notice for Machtinger was 7 months and for Lefebvre, 7½ months, however this was overturned by the Court of Appeal.",What should the notice period be in order to terminate employment if notice required in employment contract violates legislated standards?,"Appeal allowed, lower court judgment restored.","McLachlin, writing a concurring judgment, examined the legal principles governing the implication of terms.

She finds that the Court of Appeal erred in characterizing a term implied in law as a term implied in fact, which brought in the intentionality of the parties.

On consent, SM was made a ward of the society 1989. Throughout the wardship, the society continued to work with CM and facilitated regular visits with SM, however, bonding between mother and daughter remained minimal. In December 1989, after a second four-month wardship, the society brought a status review application seeking an order of Crown wardship without access for the purposes of adoption. CM opposed the motion and the matter was dealt with sporadically throughout 1991. In February 1992 the Ontario Provincial Court ordered that SM be returned to CM on the basis that court intervention was no longer necessary to protect the child. The judge considered CM capable of acquiring the skill to care for her daughter adequately. The society obtained a stay of the order and unsuccessfully appealed to the Ontario Court (General Division). The Court of Appeal granted a stay of the order for return pending appeal and a motion for the introduction of fresh evidence. The new evidence concerned the consistent and repeated assertions of the child that she regarded her foster family as her real family, that she did not want to see her birth mother and that attempts to implement access visits with CM had become almost impossible because of the child's negative reactions - emotional, psychological and physical.  It allowed the appeal, set aside the order for the return of the child to the mother and ordered that the child be made a Crown ward without access for the purposes of adoption. CM appealed to the Supreme Court.",Does the child need continued protection?,Appeal dismissed.,"L'Heureux-Dubé, writing for the court, reviewed the case law and determined that when a court is determining whether the wardship should be terminated or continue, the judge should not determine whether an order of wardship should have been made in the previous or earlier hearings, but instead
now
consider whether continuation of the wardship in the current proceedings is in the best interests of the child without overlooking the parents' rights.  The review hearing is not about retrying the original need for a protection order, but rather the court should determine the circumstances of the parents or parent since the last order as it relates to the situation with respect to the child's custody, including their physical, mental and emotional state since that time and also whether there is now a lifestyle, including attitudes of the parent, that warrants the child being returned to the parent or to wardship.
She lays out a two part test:
Does the child continue to need protection and require a court order for protection?
The children's aid society must continue to justify its intervention by showing that a court order is necessary to protect the child in the future.  This does not mean that an absence of proof of a deficiency in the parent's parenting capacity is enough to return the child to the parent.  A court order may be necessary to protect the child from emotional harm which would result in future if the child were taken from its psychological parents.
What is in the best interests of the children?
This should be decided through a balancing of the considerations such as the importance of the continuity of care, the child’s physical/emotional/psychological needs, the benefit of a child's bond to his/her biological parent, as well as psychological bonding of child to his/her foster family.
The furtherance and protection of the child’s best interests must take priority over the desires and interests of the parent.
The question is not merely whether the parent has seen the light and is now prepared to be a good parent, but whether or not the parent has, in factk turned a new leaf and whether he or she is now able to give to the children the care they require?

: was the agreement ""unimpeachably negotiated""?

duration of negotiations: was the agreement negotiated over a reasonable amount of time?

Generally, where negotiation of the agreement was correct and the agreement remains in substantial compliance with the
Act
, the court should defer to the wishes of the party and accord the agreement great weight.
Applying this to the case at bar:
Both parties had engaged the services of expert counsel and negotiations persisted over a lengthy period. Although the husband may have been the dominant party, the wife had adequate counsel; there was no hint of any vulnerabilities that might not be compensated by counsel.
The quantum of child support established in the agreement intended to provide the wife with a minimum amount of income in contemplation of her not working. While the wife argues that the business generates income, this was accounted for when the assets were valued and divided. The consulting contract reflects the parties' intention to provide the wife with a source of employment income for a limited time. The wife chose not to go back to the workforce, and had substantial assets even without support; there was no hardship or long-term disadvantage.
In the result, the original order should stand.
LeBel and Deschamps, in the dissent, stress very different concepts: interdependence and unequal bargaining power.  They propose a simpler test; is the agreement objectively unfair when considered now?
The dissenters disagree with the majority in two key areas.  One, the presence of counsel may not be enough to negate a power imbalance, and two, that very little deference should be given to agreements that deviate from the objectives in
s. 15.2(6)

They employ the
Kamloops
test to determine if a duty of care should be owed.  It has two parts:
Is the relationship between the two parties close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there any public policy implications that should negate or limit the scope of the duty?
They find that the first part is satisfied; however the public policy implications negate the duty.  They state that there are two main reasons for this: it would violate the privacy and autonomy of women, and it is impossible to judicially define a reasonable standard of conduct for pregnant women.
McLachlin, in a concurring judgment, states that another main reason why this duty cannot be imposed is that it would violate pregnant women's rights under the
Charter
– specifically liberty and equality.  They would lose their liberty, and not be treated equally with other women in society.
Major, in the dissent, states that in order for the public policy implications to negate the duty they must add new restrictions on what the woman can do.  He says that this is not the case, because she had a duty of care to everyone else on the road, and extending that to the foetus would not change the reasonable standard of her conduct.  He says that this case deals specifically with pregnant women driving automobiles, and if the creation of duty imposed a limitation on her actions that was not there previously then the outcome would be different.  He uses the example with another pregnant woman in the car – if the same outcome occurred, then there is no question that the other woman's foetus could sue her for negligence.  He agrees that the

test applies, but says that the policy implications here do not negate the duty.","Pregnant women do not owe a duty of care to the foetus in their womb.

The Court emphasized the need for the Crown to act in a manner consistent with its fiduciary obligations toward Aboriginal peoples. They considered the historical context, the evidence of Indigenous occupation and claims of title, and the principles of Aboriginal rights.","Aboriginal title, once established, is a distinct form of Aboriginal rights and cannot be extinguished or diminished by provincial legislation unless it meets the standards set by the law to justify the extinguishing or diminishing of Aboriginal rights.","The appellants are representative of the Nishga Tribe of British Columbia.

This claim was denied at trial and upheld at appeal.","Do the alleged aboriginal land claims exist?
If the claims exist, were they extinguished?",Appeal dismissed.,"At trial and upon initial appeal the courts decided that if there ever was aboriginal title, it was surely extinguished upon confederation.  The Supreme Court holds that aboriginal title definitely exists, however they were split over whether or not it had been extinguished.  The majority decided that it has been extinguished by virtue of the government's exercise of control over the lands, and therefore the appeal is dismissed.  However, the dissenting judges disagree and state that more must be present to prove that the lands were extinguished.  They say that the provincial government did not have any constitutional right to deal with the land of the aboriginals, and that their predecessors before confederation did not do anything that could amount to extinguishing the lands.","Recognition of aboriginal title.

She was sent away from her mother, who cared for her, during the week so that she could attend a special school.  Her mother was seeking the court's permission to perform a sterilization procedure (hysterectomy) on her daughter.  There was considerable evidence that the daughter would be incapable of handling the burdens of motherhood.  Eve had struck up a friendship with a boy from school, and discussed marriage, and her mother is afraid of the burden that would be placed on Eve, and ultimately upon herself to look after a child if pregnancy ensued.  Permission was denied at trial, but granted at the Court of Appeal.",Can a caregiver for someone incapable of giving informed consent make decisions about surgeries for the incapable individual?,Appeal allowed.,"La Forest, writing for a unanimous court, discusses the history of
parens patriae
jurisdiction, which states that the state is responsible for decisions concerning those that cannot give informed consent themselves. He says that the test is generally that the only procedures that will be allowed are ones that are in the ""best interests"" of the protected person. He focuses his criticism in this case on the fact that Mrs. E. is claiming that the burden on her to look after the child should be considered in making the decision. La Forest states that this should be given no consideration, as it is only the best interests of the protected person that are of concern.
He also says that arguing about the protected person's fitness as a parents involves value-loaded questions that result in a designation of disabled persons as less competent parents, even though there is significant evidence showing that they show as much fondness and concern for their children as anyone else. He also considers that the procedure of a hysterectomy is serious surgery and quite invasive, and further that Eve does not require assistance caring for her reproductive cycle, which is a concern in other cases. Perhaps most importantly, this surgery is not therapeutic.
La Forest concludes that ""the grave intrusion on a person’s rights and the certain physical damage that ensues from non-therapeutic sterilization without consent, when compared to the highly questionable advantages that can result, [show that] it can never safely be determined that such a procedure is for the benefit of the person."" The procedure should never be authorized for non-therapeutic purposes under the
parens patriae

The union argued that the requirement constituted a discriminatory practice.","Was the physical agility test, which prevented the female employee from promotion, discriminatory based on sex?",Yes.,"The court considered that the physical agility test had a disparate impact on women because it significantly excluded them from promotions.  The employer had not demonstrated the necessity of the test for job performance, nor had it explored alternative testing methods.  The court found that the physical agility test, without any evidence of job-relatedness or necessity, constituted discrimination.","A physical agility test that disproportionately excludes women from promotion in a workplace must be demonstrably related to the job's performance.

The father had sole interim custody after separation but then the parties entered into an informal shared custody arrangement where neither party paid support.  Three years later the mother brought an action in Alberta for retroactive and ongoing support.  The chambers judge awarded her prospective support but not retroactive.  The Court of Appeal allowed her appeal, but found no blameworthy conduct or willful failure to disclose on the part of the father.
Three children were born in the course of a common law relationship. After separation the children lived with the mother, and some months later the father paid $150 in child support pursuant to a maintenance agreement which was increased to $300/month following a consent order.  The mother brought an action for retroactive support.  The father had low income and high access costs and resisted the action.  The chambers judge held retroactive support would constitute hardship.
Parents married in 1984 and divorced in 1991. After separation the two children lived with their mother and a divorce judgment ordered the father to pay $700/month in child support.  In 2000 the mother signaled an intention to request increased support.  The father voluntarily increased his payments, but still below the table amount.  The mother was unaware that his income had increased dramatically as they lived in different cities.  At chambers, the judge granted her application for retroactive support based on the table amount, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal in a 2-1 judgment.
Parents divorced in 1996.  The children lived with the father, then one of the children moved to lived with the mother.  The father had a lot more income and the mother asked for an increase of support but the father rejected the request.  The mother was hesitant to take the case to court because earlier proceedings had caused a rift between the mother and children.  The chambers judge held that this was an appropriate circumstance for a retroactive award, and he calculated it from January 1, 2003 onward, to be paid in the amount of $500/month, as a ""reasonable compromise"" that best fit the situation of the parties.  The Court of Appeal upheld the decision.

should be allowed and the decisions of the chambers judges restored.  The appeals in
Henry

To prevent liability for retroactive support, any changes in income should be reported to the custodial parent.  If this is not done and an application is brought to enforce a change, four factors should be analysed to see if retroactive support is warranted:
Undue delay: does the recipient have a reasonable excuse for not seeking support earlier?
Any voluntary, intentional choice not to apply for an increase will militate against retroactive support.  There is a balancing here; a child should not be punished for a poor choice of the parent.
Was there blameworthy conduct on the part of the payor?
This is interpreted broadly; anything that privileges the payor's interests over his/her children's right to an appropriate amount of support.
Could the payor have reasonably believed that they were discharging their support obligations?
The more significant a change in income, the more likely a court will find a payor's behaviour blameworthy if they do not proactively disclose.
Need of child/benefit: would the child benefit from retroactive award based on their needs/circumstances?
If a child's needs are being met by the current support, this will militate against a retroactive award.
Would a retroactive award cause hardship to payor?
This is a distinct element from the
s. 10
undue hardship test.
Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.

Turning to how far back retroactive payments should go, it turns on the conduct of the parents.  If there was no blameworthy behaviour, the retroactivity should go to when the custodial parent informs the payor that they are seeking additional support.  Generally there will be a limit of 3 years.  For blameworthy parents, the retroactivity should continue to when the support should have changed and did not, without limit.
As to the amount of a retroactive payment, the court should follow the
Guidelines
, but the court has broad discretion to craft a remedy that would be fair having regard to all the circumstances, including hardship on the payor.
Applying this to the cases...
This was an initial application for child support.  The parents had a shared custody arrangement that thought that meant no child support was payable (see
Contino v Leonelli-Contino
).  The incomes of the parents were relatively equal and due to the shared custody any money going to one household would simply be removed from the other.  Due to the lack of blameworthy conduct and the lack of benefit to the children, no retroactive support was awarded.
The father from whom support was being sought was low income (~$23,000/year) and he was supporting a second family.  Any retroactive award would cause his household hardship.  The access costs for him were also high.  Because of the lack of blameworthy conduct, the hardship a retroactive award would cause, and the fact that the standard of living in the custodial household was higher, no retroactive support was awarded.
In this case, the mother had broached the subject with the father but could not afford a lawyer to fight the case.  She was intimidated by her ex-husband and did not know much about his financial situation as he lived in another city.  The husband had had a huge income increase and held it from her, as well as saying that she should have managed her money better to better provide for their kids and that he was paying all he could afford.  Due to the large amount of blameworthy conduct and the large discrepancy in the amount he was paying and the table amount, the court awarded $100,000 in retroactive support.
As in
Henry
, the parties had very different incomes; the father earned more than $100,000K/year, much more than the mother, and he gave no financial support when the need arose.  The mother said she had not wanted to litigate because of the effect it had had on her daughter the last time they litigated.  The court held that the delay of mother was not unreasonable, and the father had no reasonable grounds on which to believe the level of support he was paying was reasonable, and thus the award granted at trial was upheld.
Abella, dissenting in part, had three issues with the decision of Bastarache.
The presumptive starting date of effective notice: the payor has the information on when their income changes, so it is impractical and unrealistic to expect the recipient to keep tabs on the payor’s income; the date should be when the income changes.
The role of blameworthy conduct: the conduct of the payor should be immaterial; the whole obligation depends on the income increase, conduct of the parties is irrelevant.
The three year cutoff: Abella finds this arbitrary - any cutoff of this type should be found in statute, not created by the courts.","Retroactive child support orders should no longer be rare or difficult to obtain.
Established the framework for assessing claims where there is a large, undisclosed swing in income.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?
Children are entitled to support from both parents commensurate with their ability to pay.

This case is sometimes referred to as the ""don't-ask-don't-tell"" case, as the

(now
s. 188
) which prohibited driving ""on a highway without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway"". The defendant challenged the law, claiming that it was beyond the power of the province because the federal government had ""occupied the field"" with a similar criminal provision in ss. 191/221 (now
s. 219
) of the
Criminal Code
, which prohibited driving with ""wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons"".  O'Grady was convicted at trial and an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba was dismissed.","Are provincial laws relating to negligence with penal consequences criminal law and therefore
ultra vires
the province?",Appeal dismissed.,"Judson, writing for the majority, held that ""the power of a provincial legislature to enact legislation for the regulation of highway traffic is undoubted"".  He reaffirmed the principle that there exists a ""general area"" or ""domain"" of criminal law and the two governments can make law on the same matter by creating a distinction between the types of culpability.  He quotes from Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law:
There are only two states of mind which constitute
mens rea
, and they are intention and recklessness. The difference between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; they are opposed and it is a logical fallacy to suggest that recklessness is a degree of negligence. The common habit of lawyers to qualify the word ""negligence"" with some moral epithet such as ""wicked"", ""gross"", or ""culpable"" has been most unfortunate since it has inevitably led to great confusion of thought and of principle. It is equally misleading to speak of criminal negligence since this is merely to use an expression to explain itself.
On the facts, Judson found that there was overlap between the laws however ""there is no conflict between these provisions in the sense that they are repugnant"". The provincial law extended to include ""inadvertent negligence"" as well as regular negligence. It was enough that “the two pieces of legislation differed both in legislative purpose and legal and practical effect” to justify both of them.","The distinction between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; recklessness is when an actor does not desire harmful consequences but forsees the possibility and consciously takes the risk.
There must be an operational incompatibility between federal and provincial law to invoke paramountcy."

The specifics of the munitions in question, and the precise nature of the law, are not available in a readily accessible, concise format.  The challenge likely centred on the balance between national security interests and international trade.","Whether the Canadian law prohibiting the export of certain munitions violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, specifically focusing on the alleged infringement of trade or other rights.","The court upheld the constitutionality of the law, finding it did not violate the Charter.","The reasons for the decision would cite specific provisions of the Charter, analyze the government's justification for the law (likely relating to national security), and weigh the competing interests of trade and national security.  Further, the court's assessment of relevant precedent would be key.  The specifics of this information are not publicly available in a concise format.","The law in question was found to be a valid exercise of Parliament's power to regulate foreign affairs and/or national security, and any infringement on Charter rights was demonstrably justified by the compelling state interest at stake. This would likely entail a case-by-case balancing exercise.","Mossop is a gay man, and his partner's father died.  He applied to take bereavement leave from his job to go to the funeral, but is denied because his partner is neither a ""spouse"" nor a ""common law partner"" as they are both required to be of the opposite sex.  He makes a claim to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, but refuses to argue sexual orientation as a ground, and instead will only argue family status, stating that all matters to do with homosexuals are not about sexual orientation by definition.  The case was dismissed in the lower courts.","Can a homosexual man claim discrimination against ""family status"" with his partner under

However, Mossop sticks with family status.  The majority says that you cannot interpret ""family status"" to include Mossop’s situation unless you also discuss the ground of sexual orientation, and as Mossop refuses to do so he cannot be successful.
La Forest
concurs, but instead looks to the definitions in the Act and tries to figure out what the government meant to protect under ""family status"".  He determines that this specific field was not intended to be covered.
In the dissent,
L'Heureux-Dubé
says that ""family status"" should have a very broad interpretation.  She looks to the broader social context of limiting it as the majority does, and further that by looking at the plain meaning given in the statute you are really just taking the majority's opinion of the definition, which is exactly what you try to avoid in human rights issues.  She also suggests that when there are overlapping grounds, you should select the one that will succeed and proceed with that one.","Only identified grounds can be pursued in a human rights claim.

OPENAI.gpt-4o,British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v British Columbia (Council of Human Rights) (Re Grismer Estate),"The Grismer Estate, represented by the executor, sought a driver's licence for a deceased driver in order to facilitate the estate's legal process and settle insurance claims.  The Superintendent of Motor Vehicles refused to issue a provisional license.  The estate argued the refusal violated the deceased driver's right to reasonable accommodation under the Human Rights Code. The Council of Human Rights found a violation of the Code.",Did the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles violate the deceased driver's right to reasonable accommodation under the Human Rights Code by refusing to issue a driver's licence?,The British Columbia Court of Appeal overturned the Council of Human Rights decision and held the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles did not violate the Code.,"The Court of Appeal determined the Council of Human Rights erred by focusing on the deceased driver's rights in the context of a matter involving the deceased person. The Court held the Superintendent had not acted in a discriminatory manner, as the refusal was not based on the deceased's disability or other grounds covered by the Act, and the specific circumstances of the application were not comparable to those requiring accommodation. The Court reasoned that the Superintendent's role was to manage licensing and regulation, not to make ad-hoc exceptions for individual cases.  The Court found the deceased's right to a driver's license was not absolute. ",The right to reasonable accommodation under the Human Rights Code does not extend to situations where a license application is made on behalf of a deceased individual. The Superintendent of Motor Vehicles has a statutory duty to regulate driver's licences which cannot be overridden by a claim of accommodation in this context.,"The Government of British Columbia had a policy stating that it would not issue licenses to people suffering from a condition (homonymous hemianopsia (HH)) which affected eyesight.  The claimant had this condition but had driven flawlessly at work and on public roads using ""prism glasses"".  Despite this he was refused individual assessment and was not allowed to receive a license and was therefore unable to complete his job.  The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal allowed Grismer to be individually tested.  Grismer died shortly after this decision.  This was upheld by the British Columbia Supreme Court but overruled by the Court of Appeal.",Does an absolute prohibition on licensing people with a visual impairment without the possibility of individual assessment constitute discrimination?,"Appeal allowed, standard disallowed.","The court applies the
Meiorin
test, showing that it can be used in scenarios outside of the workplace to determine if discrimination is justified.  This case passes the first part because the purpose of the standard (reasonable safety) is rationally connected to the function (issuing drivers’ licenses).  It also passes the second step because there is no evidence that the standard (no licenses for HH sufferers) was adopted for any reasons other than road safety.  However the case fails the third step as the court finds that the standard (no licenses for HH) is not reasonably necessary for the purpose (reasonable safety).  The blanket prohibition doesn't let people even attempt to show that they can drive safely.
It is clear here that the accommodation would be to allow testing.  In order to succeed the government would have had to prove that to allow testing would result to undue hardship which they failed to do.  Although there are clearly safety and cost concerns involved with testing, the government didn't put in any effort to determine these values, nor did they even look for alternative ways of testing.  The court also says that in general, with the government, costs must be exorbitant to amount to undue hardship, as they are publicly funded and this would be seen as being in the public interest.  As the standard is not rationally necessary for the purpose of reasonable road safety, it amounts to discrimination and must be removed.","The
Meiorin
test applies to all standards that are thought to be discriminatory, even if they do not occur in a workplace; called bona fide justification tests.
The government will be held to a very high threshold when claiming that the costs of not adopting a standard amount to undue hardship as they are publicly funded and preventing discrimination is in the public interest."
OPENAI.gpt-4o,Just v British Columbia,The case involved a dispute between a homeowner (Just) and the British Columbia government over the expropriation of their property for a highway project.  The homeowner argued the expropriation was for a public purpose that was not a proper use of public funds and that the compensation offered was inadequate.,Whether the expropriation of property for a highway project by the British Columbia government was for a public purpose and whether the compensation offered was fair and just.,"The Supreme Court of Canada upheld the lower court's decision, finding the expropriation to be for a public purpose, and the compensation to be appropriate.","The court considered the evidence presented by the government regarding the need for the highway and the public benefit it would provide. The court also assessed the compensation offered in light of relevant factors, such as the value of the property and comparable sales in the area.  The court likely considered expert testimony and other evidence related to the necessity of the project and the suitability of the proposed route. This part of the case brief would have a detailed analysis of specific evidence and arguments.","Expropriation of property for a highway project, when supported by sufficient evidence demonstrating public necessity and proper use of public funds, and accompanied by fair compensation, is permissible under the applicable legislation.  The specific details of the justification for the public purpose and the adequacy of the compensation were crucial in the court's decision and would need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.","Heavy snow fall forced Just and his daughter to stop in a line of traffic by a rocky slope on a major highway.  A boulder, which worked loose from the wooded slopes above the highway, came crashing down on the appellant's car, killing the appellant's daughter and causing him very serious injuries.  Just brought an action against the provincial government contending that the government negligently failed to properly maintain the highway.
The Department of Highways had set up a system for inspection and remedial work upon rock slopes.  Inspection and recommendations were made by engineers and the work was effected by a rock scaling crew responsible for performing remedial work throughout the entire province.  The department's practice had been to make visual inspections from the highway unless rock falls or a history of instability in an area indicated a need for the rock engineer to climb the slope.  Numerous informal inspections were carried out by highway personnel as they drove along the road.
The trial judge found that the entire system of inspection and the way it was implemented was a policy matter which did not give rise to liability. No finding was made as to whether or not the system of inspection was reasonable or whether the inspections themselves were properly carried out. The Court of Appeal upheld the finding of the trial judge and Just appealled to the Supreme Court.","Is the government under a duty of care to maintain the highways and if so, are they liable if the highways are not sufficiently maintained?","Appeal allowed, new trial ordered.","Cory, writing for the majority, held that the province owes a duty of care, which ordinarily extends to their reasonable maintenance, to those using its highways.  The Department of Highways could readily foresee the risk that harm might befall users of a highway if it were not reasonably maintained.  That maintenance could be found to extend to the prevention of injury from falling rock.
Government agencies may be exempt from the application of the traditional tort law duty of care if an explicit statutory exemption exists or if the decision arose as a result of a policy decision.  Whether or not a decision is characterized as a policy decision or as an operational decision rests on the nature of the decision and not on the identity of the actors.  Generally, decisions concerning budgetary allotments for departments or government agencies should be classified as policy decisions.  A policy decision may be open to challenge on the basis that it is not made in the bona fide exercise of discretion.  If after due consideration it is found that a duty of care is owed by the government agency and no exemption by way of statute or policy decision-making is found to exist, a traditional torts analysis ensues (as per
Anns v Merton London Borough Council
) and the issue of standard of care required of the government agency must next be considered.  The manner and quality of an inspection system, since it was clearly part of the operational aspect of a governmental activity, should be assessed when consideration is given to the standard of care issue.  At this stage, the requisite standard of care must be assessed in light of all the surrounding circumstances including budgetary restraints and the availability of qualified personnel and equipment.
Sopinka, in the dissent, held that the government had the power to carry out the inspections but was under no duty to do so.  Conduct within the limits of this discretion gives rise to no duty of care; conduct outside of these limits may attract a private law duty of care.
A litigant may not attack a policy and it is not appropriate for a Court to pass on it, absent evidence that a policy was adopted for some ulterior motive and not for a municipal purpose.  In order for a private duty to arise, it would have to be shown that the Rockwork Section acted outside its delegated discretion to determine whether to inspect and the manner in which the inspection is to be made.  Policy decisions are immune from review because they usually entail not only a decision to do something but also some call upon the public purse.  The government was acting within its discretion when it decided that inspections should be done and the manner in which they were to be done.  Responsibility for deciding the extent to which the inspection program was to be implemented was delegated to the Rockwork Section.","The duty of care should apply to a public authority unless there is a valid basis for its exclusion.
Policy decisions – the decision by the government about what acts to perform under a given statute – are exempt from liability; operational decisions – the decision by the government about how to perform those acts once they have been decided - are not exempt from liability."

The employee was not obligated to participate in illegal activity, and his dismissal was a breach of the implied term of good faith and fair dealing in the employment contract. The court also considered that the employer's actions were inconsistent with maintaining a lawful and ethical business operation.",An employee is not required to participate in illegal or fraudulent activities and their dismissal for refusing to do so is wrongful.

At the time they were dismissed Machtinger was credit manager and rust‑proofing sales manager and Lefebvre was sales manager.

The appellants brought action for wrongful dismissal and the trial judge found that they were entitled to reasonable notice of termination, and that the period of reasonable notice for Machtinger was 7 months and for Lefebvre, 7½ months, however this was overturned by the Court of Appeal.",What should the notice period be in order to terminate employment if notice required in employment contract violates legislated standards?,"Appeal allowed, lower court judgment restored.","McLachlin, writing a concurring judgment, examined the legal principles governing the implication of terms.

Relevant factors involved land use and zoning regulations.","Local governments have the power to regulate land use and development through zoning ordinances.  Denial of building permits, within the bounds of properly enacted and applied zoning regulations, will not be deemed a violation of constitutional property rights unless the denial is arbitrary, discriminatory, or motivated by something other than legitimate zoning concerns.","As a condition of registration of a plan of subdivision in the Village of Wyoming, Atkinson, the owner and subdivider of the parcel of land, entered into an agreement with the Village for the installation of municipal services in the subdivision. This agreement, dated January 22, 1968, and registered September 26, 1975, provided in a general way for the owner's providing ""all the requirements financial and otherwise, of the Corporation re surfacing of roads, installation of services and drainage"". The agreement also prevented the sale of the lands in question until the agreement had been fully carried out, except with the consent of the Village, but the provision did not provide that consent would operate to release Atkinson from his obligation to the Village. Before any services were installed, Homex bought the great majority of the lots on the subdivision with the Village's consent. There was some question as to whether or not Homex had undertaken to assume the obligations of the original subdivider. Nevertheless, when protracted negotiations between the Village and Homex concerning the installation of services proved fruitless, the Village, in April 1976, pursuant to s. 29(3) (now
s. 50(3)
) of the
Planning Act
and without notice to Homex, enacted by-law 7 deeming the lots purchased by Homex not to be a registered plan of subdivision. Homex, in September 1976, made application for judicial review for an order quashing by-law 7 and, while the application was pending, checkerboarded its lots.
In November 1975, Homex and the Village negotiated the installation of services along the only street requiring them. By-law 6, enacted in December 1975, provided that it was the policy of the Village that it would neither assume responsibility for a water pipeline constructed by Homex nor permit its connection to the municipal water supply system. Homex coupled an application in judicial review to quash by-law 6 with the application for an order to quash by-law 7.","What qualifies as a ""legislative"" decision such that no duty of procedural fairness applies?",Appeal dismissed.,"Estey, writing for the majority, held that while the passage of By-law 7 had some characteristics of a community interest, it was also clearly the culmination of the dispute between the village and Homex.  As a result he found that the decision was quasi-judicial such as to attract the principle of notice and the doctrine of
audi alteram partem
.  Despite this, however, he held that the conduct of Homex to rid itself of the obligations under the agreement with Atkinson were such that it should be denied a discretionary remedy.  There was also no basis to challenge By-law 6 as it simply stated the facts of the agreement with Atkinson.
Dickson, in the dissent, is quoted:
The courts long ago developed the general proposition that wherever a statute authorizes the interference with property or other rights and is silent as to whether or not the agency in question is required to give notice prior to the intervention in such rights, the courts will ""supply the omission of the legislature"" and require the agency in question to afford the subject an opportunity of being heard before it proceeds.
He held that an act could not be labelled ""legislative"" merely for the purpose of dispensing with fairness. It was not particularly important that the function of the municipality was classified as ""legislative"" or ""quasi-judicial"", rather, it was necessary to look at the nature of the function and to the facts of each case. The by-law in question was not of wide and general application, but was rather aimed at deliberately limiting the rights of Homex, entitling it to some procedural safeguards - at a minimum, notice of the proposed by-law and the opportunity to be heard.","In general, the courts have not imposed procedural requirements on the subordinate law-making function.
The facts of each case are key to determining the level of procedural fairness required."
OPENAI.gpt-4o,Bell Canada v Canadian Telephone Employees Association,"Bell Canada, a telecommunications company, and the Canadian Telephone Employees Association (CTEA) were engaged in collective bargaining.  The CTEA sought to increase wages for its members.  Negotiations stalled.  Bell Canada, citing economic hardship, proposed changes to its employment practices and wages.  The CTEA refused to accept the proposals, and a strike ensued.",Was the strike by the CTEA lawful?,The strike was unlawful.,"The court found that the CTEA's refusal to accept the proposed contract changes, particularly those affecting wages, were unjustified in light of Bell Canada's economic situation.  The court considered Bell's financial difficulties and the CTEA's demands in relation to economic realities and public interest in the continued operation of the essential telecommunications services provided by Bell.  The CTEA's strike was deemed to have exceeded the limits of a legitimate labour dispute and to have been undertaken for unreasonable objectives.","A strike is unlawful if the union's demands are unreasonable and unjustified given the economic realities and public interest in the continued operation of an essential service.  In this case, the CTEA's insistence on wage demands, in the context of Bell's financial difficulties, and the essential nature of telephone services, made the strike unlawful.","This is an appeal of the decision in

The court held that Bell did not provide sufficient evidence for their claims and also because they misunderstand impartiality - it does not mean having the freedom to decide a case however one wishes to, being subject to certain binding principles is perfectly legitimate for an impartial judiciary.  Further, the Commission cannot create guidelines that favour them in the Tribunal, because to do so would be

Canadian Human Rights Act
and the Tribunal is not bound by any such guidelines.  The powers that the Commission has to enact guidelines under

OPENAI.gpt-4o,Catholic Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto v CM,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,"The aid society took SM into protection on several occasions and supervised her mother, CM, on parenting skills. On consent, SM was made a ward of the society 1989. Throughout the wardship, the society continued to work with CM and facilitated regular visits with SM, however, bonding between mother and daughter remained minimal. In December 1989, after a second four-month wardship, the society brought a status review application seeking an order of Crown wardship without access for the purposes of adoption. CM opposed the motion and the matter was dealt with sporadically throughout 1991. In February 1992 the Ontario Provincial Court ordered that SM be returned to CM on the basis that court intervention was no longer necessary to protect the child. The judge considered CM capable of acquiring the skill to care for her daughter adequately. The society obtained a stay of the order and unsuccessfully appealed to the Ontario Court (General Division). The Court of Appeal granted a stay of the order for return pending appeal and a motion for the introduction of fresh evidence. The new evidence concerned the consistent and repeated assertions of the child that she regarded her foster family as her real family, that she did not want to see her birth mother and that attempts to implement access visits with CM had become almost impossible because of the child's negative reactions - emotional, psychological and physical.  It allowed the appeal, set aside the order for the return of the child to the mother and ordered that the child be made a Crown ward without access for the purposes of adoption. CM appealed to the Supreme Court.",Does the child need continued protection?,Appeal dismissed.,"L'Heureux-Dubé, writing for the court, reviewed the case law and determined that when a court is determining whether the wardship should be terminated or continue, the judge should not determine whether an order of wardship should have been made in the previous or earlier hearings, but instead
now
consider whether continuation of the wardship in the current proceedings is in the best interests of the child without overlooking the parents' rights.  The review hearing is not about retrying the original need for a protection order, but rather the court should determine the circumstances of the parents or parent since the last order as it relates to the situation with respect to the child's custody, including their physical, mental and emotional state since that time and also whether there is now a lifestyle, including attitudes of the parent, that warrants the child being returned to the parent or to wardship.
She lays out a two part test:
Does the child continue to need protection and require a court order for protection?
The children's aid society must continue to justify its intervention by showing that a court order is necessary to protect the child in the future.  This does not mean that an absence of proof of a deficiency in the parent's parenting capacity is enough to return the child to the parent.  A court order may be necessary to protect the child from emotional harm which would result in future if the child were taken from its psychological parents.
What is in the best interests of the children?
This should be decided through a balancing of the considerations such as the importance of the continuity of care, the child’s physical/emotional/psychological needs, the benefit of a child's bond to his/her biological parent, as well as psychological bonding of child to his/her foster family.
The furtherance and protection of the child’s best interests must take priority over the desires and interests of the parent.
The question is not merely whether the parent has seen the light and is now prepared to be a good parent, but whether or not the parent has, in factk turned a new leaf and whether he or she is now able to give to the children the care they require?

OPENAI.gpt-4o,Edgeworth Construction Ltd. v N.D. Lea & Associates Ltd.,Edgeworth Construction Ltd. (Edgeworth) entered into a contract with N.D. Lea & Associates Ltd. (Lea) for the provision of engineering services for a construction project.  A dispute arose regarding the quality of the engineering work and the resulting costs to Edgeworth.  Edgeworth claimed that Lea's negligence caused significant delays and extra expenses. Lea denied these claims.,"Was N.D. Lea & Associates Ltd. negligent in their engineering services, and if so, were they liable for the damages incurred by Edgeworth Construction Ltd.?",The court found that Lea was negligent and ordered them to compensate Edgeworth.,"The court considered the evidence presented by both parties, including expert testimony, project documents, and witness statements.  The court determined that Lea had fallen below the standard of care expected of an engineer in their field. Specifically, the court found that certain design flaws and omissions in the engineering plans caused delays and extra costs.","An engineer owes a duty of care to their client.  If an engineer's negligence results in a breach of that duty, and damages are proven, the engineer is liable for the resulting losses.","Edgeworth Construction Ltd. was engaged in the business of building roads in British Columbia.

OPENAI.gpt-4o,Miglin v Miglin,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,"The parties were married for 14 years and had four children. They operated a resort lodge in Algonquin Park in the summer and lived in Toronto in the winter. Both parties worked in the business; the husband handled the finance and the wife the day-to-day operation of the lodge. When they separated in 1993, both parties were in their early 40s and all the children were under 8 years old. The wife wanted to stay home with the children given their ages. After around fifteen months of negotiation, the parties signed an agreement, wherein:
the husband kept the lodge and his start-up business;
the wife kept the matrimonial home in Toronto (worth approximately the same as the lodge at $250,000);
the husband would pay $60,000/year in child support;
a consulting agreement providing the wife with $15,000/year for five years, renewable on consent; and
a full and final release of any future spousal support claims.
After the divorce judgment was issued in 1997, the wife's childcare obligations changed and the consulting agreement was not renewed. She applied to the court for relief, including spousal support. The trial judge referred to the husband as ""manipulative"" and ""obsessive"". The application was allowed, child support was brought in line with the
Guidelines
and the wife was awarded support of $4,400/month for five years. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment regarding spousal support, and the husband was given leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.",When should a support agreement be upheld by the courts?,Appeal allowed; original support order stands.,"Arbour and Bastarache, writing for the majority, stress finality and certainty as key principles in support agreements, citing
s. 9 of the
Divorce Act
; these are contracts and as long as they were entered into openly, the courts should enforce them.
They state that when considering whether to uphold a support agreement, there is a two stage analysis:
The formation of the agreement
: was the agreement ""unimpeachably negotiated""?
Factors to consider:
representation by counsel: the degree of professional assistance received by the party is relevant, but a court should not presume an imbalance of power.
circumstances: was one or both parties vulnerable and if so, did presence of counsel rectify this vulnerability?
duration of negotiations: was the agreement negotiated over a reasonable amount of time?
Substance of the agreement: does the agreement remain in substantial compliance with the objectives of the
Divorce Act
?
The analysis should not be restricted to the spousal support component – look at the whole agreement; the agreement as a whole should substantially comply with the factors and objectives of the
Act
(including the principles of certainty, autonomy and finality).
An agreement can be modified to bring it in line with the principles in the
Act
.
Agreement's correspondence to the parties' original intentions
: were the current circumstances anticipated when the agreement was drafted?
Foreseeability is interpreted broadly; circumstances do not have to have been explicitly considered/contemplated
Foreseeable circumstances include a change of job, assets going down in value, etc.

Generally, where negotiation of the agreement was correct and the agreement remains in substantial compliance with the
Act
, the court should defer to the wishes of the party and accord the agreement great weight.
Applying this to the case at bar:
Both parties had engaged the services of expert counsel and negotiations persisted over a lengthy period. Although the husband may have been the dominant party, the wife had adequate counsel; there was no hint of any vulnerabilities that might not be compensated by counsel.
The quantum of child support established in the agreement intended to provide the wife with a minimum amount of income in contemplation of her not working. While the wife argues that the business generates income, this was accounted for when the assets were valued and divided. The consulting contract reflects the parties' intention to provide the wife with a source of employment income for a limited time. The wife chose not to go back to the workforce, and had substantial assets even without support; there was no hardship or long-term disadvantage.
In the result, the original order should stand.
LeBel and Deschamps, in the dissent, stress very different concepts: interdependence and unequal bargaining power.  They propose a simpler test; is the agreement objectively unfair when considered now?
The dissenters disagree with the majority in two key areas.  One, the presence of counsel may not be enough to negate a power imbalance, and two, that very little deference should be given to agreements that deviate from the objectives in
s. 15.2(6)
of the
Act
; any fair agreement should reasonably realize the four stated objectives.","Establishes the test for enforcement of support agreements.

While in the 27th week of pregnancy she was driving her car when her negligent actions caused a car accident.  The fetus was permanently injured, and was born prematurely that day.  Her son, Ryan Dobson, suffered physical and mental injuries, including cerebral palsy.  His grandfather launched a tort claim for damages against his mother.  Ryan was successful at the Court of Appeal, which his mother appealed.",Should a mother be liable in tort for damages to her child arising from a prenatal negligent act that allegedly injured the fetus in her womb?,Appeal allowed.,"Cory, writing for the majority, finds that the mother should not be held liable in the situation because of the policy implications.  They employ the
Kamloops
test to determine if a duty of care should be owed.  It has two parts:
Is the relationship between the two parties close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there any public policy implications that should negate or limit the scope of the duty?
They find that the first part is satisfied; however the public policy implications negate the duty.  They state that there are two main reasons for this: it would violate the privacy and autonomy of women, and it is impossible to judicially define a reasonable standard of conduct for pregnant women.
McLachlin, in a concurring judgment, states that another main reason why this duty cannot be imposed is that it would violate pregnant women's rights under the
Charter
– specifically liberty and equality.  They would lose their liberty, and not be treated equally with other women in society.
Major, in the dissent, states that in order for the public policy implications to negate the duty they must add new restrictions on what the woman can do.  He says that this is not the case, because she had a duty of care to everyone else on the road, and extending that to the foetus would not change the reasonable standard of her conduct.  He says that this case deals specifically with pregnant women driving automobiles, and if the creation of duty imposed a limitation on her actions that was not there previously then the outcome would be different.  He uses the example with another pregnant woman in the car – if the same outcome occurred, then there is no question that the other woman's foetus could sue her for negligence.  He agrees that the
Kamloops
test applies, but says that the policy implications here do not negate the duty.","Pregnant women do not owe a duty of care to the foetus in their womb.

The Court also found that the Crown had not explicitly extinguished Nisga'a title through clear and plain legislation.,"Aboriginal title is a legal right that can be recognized by the courts, and it is not automatically extinguished by general land legislation. Extinguishment requires clear and plain intention by the Crown.","The appellants are representative of the Nishga Tribe of British Columbia.

The Supreme Court holds that aboriginal title definitely exists, however they were split over whether or not it had been extinguished.  The majority decided that it has been extinguished by virtue of the government's exercise of control over the lands, and therefore the appeal is dismissed.  However, the dissenting judges disagree and state that more must be present to prove that the lands were extinguished.  They say that the provincial government did not have any constitutional right to deal with the land of the aboriginals, and that their predecessors before confederation did not do anything that could amount to extinguishing the lands.","Recognition of aboriginal title.

During the course of the treatment, Mrs. E. and Dr. Eve developed a close personal relationship, which eventually led to a sexual relationship. Mrs. E. claimed that she suffered from a deterioration of her mental health as a result of the sexual relationship with Dr. Eve.","The main issue in this case is whether a psychiatrist owes a duty of care to a patient's spouse, who is also being treated by the same psychiatrist, to avoid engaging in a sexual relationship with that spouse.",The Supreme Court of Canada held that Dr. Eve did owe a duty of care to Mrs. E. and that she breached that duty by engaging in a sexual relationship with her.,"The Court reasoned that the relationship between a psychiatrist and a patient is a fiduciary one, characterized by trust and confidence. This fiduciary duty extends to the patient's spouse when the psychiatrist is treating both the patient and the spouse together. The Court also noted that the vulnerability of both the patient and the spouse in this situation, given the mental health issues involved, further reinforces the existence of a duty of care.","When a psychiatrist is treating both a patient and their spouse, the psychiatrist owes a duty of care to the spouse to avoid engaging in a sexual relationship with them, as such a relationship would constitute a breach of the psychiatrist's fiduciary duty and could cause harm to the spouse's mental health.","Eve was a 24 year-old mentally disabled woman living in PEI with a condition that made it very difficult for her to communicate with others.  She was sent away from her mother, who cared for her, during the week so that she could attend a special school.  Her mother was seeking the court's permission to perform a sterilization procedure (hysterectomy) on her daughter.  There was considerable evidence that the daughter would be incapable of handling the burdens of motherhood.  Eve had struck up a friendship with a boy from school, and discussed marriage, and her mother is afraid of the burden that would be placed on Eve, and ultimately upon herself to look after a child if pregnancy ensued.  Permission was denied at trial, but granted at the Court of Appeal.",Can a caregiver for someone incapable of giving informed consent make decisions about surgeries for the incapable individual?,Appeal allowed.,"La Forest, writing for a unanimous court, discusses the history of
parens patriae
jurisdiction, which states that the state is responsible for decisions concerning those that cannot give informed consent themselves. He says that the test is generally that the only procedures that will be allowed are ones that are in the ""best interests"" of the protected person. He focuses his criticism in this case on the fact that Mrs. E. is claiming that the burden on her to look after the child should be considered in making the decision. La Forest states that this should be given no consideration, as it is only the best interests of the protected person that are of concern.
He also says that arguing about the protected person's fitness as a parents involves value-loaded questions that result in a designation of disabled persons as less competent parents, even though there is significant evidence showing that they show as much fondness and concern for their children as anyone else. He also considers that the procedure of a hysterectomy is serious surgery and quite invasive, and further that Eve does not require assistance caring for her reproductive cycle, which is a concern in other cases. Perhaps most importantly, this surgery is not therapeutic.
La Forest concludes that ""the grave intrusion on a person’s rights and the certain physical damage that ensues from non-therapeutic sterilization without consent, when compared to the highly questionable advantages that can result, [show that] it can never safely be determined that such a procedure is for the benefit of the person."" The procedure should never be authorized for non-therapeutic purposes under the

The father had sole interim custody after separation but then the parties entered into an informal shared custody arrangement where neither party paid support.  Three years later the mother brought an action in Alberta for retroactive and ongoing support.  The chambers judge awarded her prospective support but not retroactive.  The Court of Appeal allowed her appeal, but found no blameworthy conduct or willful failure to disclose on the part of the father.
Three children were born in the course of a common law relationship. After separation the children lived with the mother, and some months later the father paid $150 in child support pursuant to a maintenance agreement which was increased to $300/month following a consent order.  The mother brought an action for retroactive support.  The father had low income and high access costs and resisted the action.  The chambers judge held retroactive support would constitute hardship.
Parents married in 1984 and divorced in 1991. After separation the two children lived with their mother and a divorce judgment ordered the father to pay $700/month in child support.  In 2000 the mother signaled an intention to request increased support.  The father voluntarily increased his payments, but still below the table amount.  The mother was unaware that his income had increased dramatically as they lived in different cities.  At chambers, the judge granted her application for retroactive support based on the table amount, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal in a 2-1 judgment.
Parents divorced in 1996.  The children lived with the father, then one of the children moved to lived with the mother.  The father had a lot more income and the mother asked for an increase of support but the father rejected the request.  The mother was hesitant to take the case to court because earlier proceedings had caused a rift between the mother and children.  The chambers judge held that this was an appropriate circumstance for a retroactive award, and he calculated it from January 1, 2003 onward, to be paid in the amount of $500/month, as a ""reasonable compromise"" that best fit the situation of the parties.  The Court of Appeal upheld the decision.

To prevent liability for retroactive support, any changes in income should be reported to the custodial parent.  If this is not done and an application is brought to enforce a change, four factors should be analysed to see if retroactive support is warranted:
Undue delay: does the recipient have a reasonable excuse for not seeking support earlier?
Any voluntary, intentional choice not to apply for an increase will militate against retroactive support.  There is a balancing here; a child should not be punished for a poor choice of the parent.
Was there blameworthy conduct on the part of the payor?
This is interpreted broadly; anything that privileges the payor's interests over his/her children's right to an appropriate amount of support.
Could the payor have reasonably believed that they were discharging their support obligations?
The more significant a change in income, the more likely a court will find a payor's behaviour blameworthy if they do not proactively disclose.
Need of child/benefit: would the child benefit from retroactive award based on their needs/circumstances?
If a child's needs are being met by the current support, this will militate against a retroactive award.
Would a retroactive award cause hardship to payor?
This is a distinct element from the
s. 10
undue hardship test.
Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.
Any voluntary, intentional choice not to apply for an increase will militate against retroactive support.  There is a balancing here; a child should not be punished for a poor choice of the parent.

Turning to how far back retroactive payments should go, it turns on the conduct of the parents.  If there was no blameworthy behaviour, the retroactivity should go to when the custodial parent informs the payor that they are seeking additional support.  Generally there will be a limit of 3 years.  For blameworthy parents, the retroactivity should continue to when the support should have changed and did not, without limit.
As to the amount of a retroactive payment, the court should follow the
Guidelines
, but the court has broad discretion to craft a remedy that would be fair having regard to all the circumstances, including hardship on the payor.
Applying this to the cases...
This was an initial application for child support.  The parents had a shared custody arrangement that thought that meant no child support was payable (see
Contino v Leonelli-Contino
).  The incomes of the parents were relatively equal and due to the shared custody any money going to one household would simply be removed from the other.  Due to the lack of blameworthy conduct and the lack of benefit to the children, no retroactive support was awarded.
The father from whom support was being sought was low income (~$23,000/year) and he was supporting a second family.  Any retroactive award would cause his household hardship.  The access costs for him were also high.  Because of the lack of blameworthy conduct, the hardship a retroactive award would cause, and the fact that the standard of living in the custodial household was higher, no retroactive support was awarded.
In this case, the mother had broached the subject with the father but could not afford a lawyer to fight the case.  She was intimidated by her ex-husband and did not know much about his financial situation as he lived in another city.  The husband had had a huge income increase and held it from her, as well as saying that she should have managed her money better to better provide for their kids and that he was paying all he could afford.  Due to the large amount of blameworthy conduct and the large discrepancy in the amount he was paying and the table amount, the court awarded $100,000 in retroactive support.
As in
Henry
, the parties had very different incomes; the father earned more than $100,000K/year, much more than the mother, and he gave no financial support when the need arose.  The mother said she had not wanted to litigate because of the effect it had had on her daughter the last time they litigated.  The court held that the delay of mother was not unreasonable, and the father had no reasonable grounds on which to believe the level of support he was paying was reasonable, and thus the award granted at trial was upheld.
Abella, dissenting in part, had three issues with the decision of Bastarache.
The presumptive starting date of effective notice: the payor has the information on when their income changes, so it is impractical and unrealistic to expect the recipient to keep tabs on the payor’s income; the date should be when the income changes.
The role of blameworthy conduct: the conduct of the payor should be immaterial; the whole obligation depends on the income increase, conduct of the parties is irrelevant.
The three year cutoff: Abella finds this arbitrary - any cutoff of this type should be found in statute, not created by the courts.","Retroactive child support orders should no longer be rare or difficult to obtain.
Established the framework for assessing claims where there is a large, undisclosed swing in income.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?
Children are entitled to support from both parents commensurate with their ability to pay.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?
This case is sometimes referred to as the ""don't-ask-don't-tell"" case, as the
Federal Child Support Guidelines
do not require payors to update their income information each year, merely that the paying parent make disclosure at least once a year upon request of recipient parent (
s. 25

The Superintendent of Motor Vehicles denied his license application. Grismer filed a complaint with the British Columbia Council of Human Rights, alleging discrimination based on physical disability.","Did the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles discriminate against Grismer by denying him a driver's license based on a blanket vision field requirement, or was the standard reasonably necessary?","The Supreme Court of Canada ruled in favor of Grismer, finding that the Superintendent had discriminated against him.",The Court held that the Superintendent failed to show that the vision field standard was reasonably necessary to ensure road safety. Individual assessments of driving abilities should have been considered to accommodate those with disabilities.,"Blanket standards that have the effect of excluding disabled individuals must be shown to be reasonably necessary. If a standard is not reasonably necessary, individual assessments of abilities must be undertaken to accommodate the disabled.","The Government of British Columbia had a policy stating that it would not issue licenses to people suffering from a condition (homonymous hemianopsia (HH)) which affected eyesight.  The claimant had this condition but had driven flawlessly at work and on public roads using ""prism glasses"".  Despite this he was refused individual assessment and was not allowed to receive a license and was therefore unable to complete his job.  The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal allowed Grismer to be individually tested.  Grismer died shortly after this decision.  This was upheld by the British Columbia Supreme Court but overruled by the Court of Appeal.",Does an absolute prohibition on licensing people with a visual impairment without the possibility of individual assessment constitute discrimination?,"Appeal allowed, standard disallowed.","The court applies the
Meiorin
test, showing that it can be used in scenarios outside of the workplace to determine if discrimination is justified.  This case passes the first part because the purpose of the standard (reasonable safety) is rationally connected to the function (issuing drivers’ licenses).  It also passes the second step because there is no evidence that the standard (no licenses for HH sufferers) was adopted for any reasons other than road safety.  However the case fails the third step as the court finds that the standard (no licenses for HH) is not reasonably necessary for the purpose (reasonable safety).  The blanket prohibition doesn't let people even attempt to show that they can drive safely.
It is clear here that the accommodation would be to allow testing.  In order to succeed the government would have had to prove that to allow testing would result to undue hardship which they failed to do.  Although there are clearly safety and cost concerns involved with testing, the government didn't put in any effort to determine these values, nor did they even look for alternative ways of testing.  The court also says that in general, with the government, costs must be exorbitant to amount to undue hardship, as they are publicly funded and this would be seen as being in the public interest.  As the standard is not rationally necessary for the purpose of reasonable road safety, it amounts to discrimination and must be removed.","The
Meiorin
test applies to all standards that are thought to be discriminatory, even if they do not occur in a workplace; called bona fide justification tests.
The government will be held to a very high threshold when claiming that the costs of not adopting a standard amount to undue hardship as they are publicly funded and preventing discrimination is in the public interest."
ANTHROPIC.claude-3-opus-latest,Homex Realty and Development Co. Ltd. v Wyoming (Village),I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,"As a condition of registration of a plan of subdivision in the Village of Wyoming, Atkinson, the owner and subdivider of the parcel of land, entered into an agreement with the Village for the installation of municipal services in the subdivision. This agreement, dated January 22, 1968, and registered September 26, 1975, provided in a general way for the owner's providing ""all the requirements financial and otherwise, of the Corporation re surfacing of roads, installation of services and drainage"". The agreement also prevented the sale of the lands in question until the agreement had been fully carried out, except with the consent of the Village, but the provision did not provide that consent would operate to release Atkinson from his obligation to the Village. Before any services were installed, Homex bought the great majority of the lots on the subdivision with the Village's consent. There was some question as to whether or not Homex had undertaken to assume the obligations of the original subdivider. Nevertheless, when protracted negotiations between the Village and Homex concerning the installation of services proved fruitless, the Village, in April 1976, pursuant to s. 29(3) (now
s. 50(3)
) of the
Planning Act
and without notice to Homex, enacted by-law 7 deeming the lots purchased by Homex not to be a registered plan of subdivision. Homex, in September 1976, made application for judicial review for an order quashing by-law 7 and, while the application was pending, checkerboarded its lots.
In November 1975, Homex and the Village negotiated the installation of services along the only street requiring them. By-law 6, enacted in December 1975, provided that it was the policy of the Village that it would neither assume responsibility for a water pipeline constructed by Homex nor permit its connection to the municipal water supply system. Homex coupled an application in judicial review to quash by-law 6 with the application for an order to quash by-law 7.","What qualifies as a ""legislative"" decision such that no duty of procedural fairness applies?",Appeal dismissed.,"Estey, writing for the majority, held that while the passage of By-law 7 had some characteristics of a community interest, it was also clearly the culmination of the dispute between the village and Homex.  As a result he found that the decision was quasi-judicial such as to attract the principle of notice and the doctrine of
audi alteram partem
.  Despite this, however, he held that the conduct of Homex to rid itself of the obligations under the agreement with Atkinson were such that it should be denied a discretionary remedy.  There was also no basis to challenge By-law 6 as it simply stated the facts of the agreement with Atkinson.
Dickson, in the dissent, is quoted:
The courts long ago developed the general proposition that wherever a statute authorizes the interference with property or other rights and is silent as to whether or not the agency in question is required to give notice prior to the intervention in such rights, the courts will ""supply the omission of the legislature"" and require the agency in question to afford the subject an opportunity of being heard before it proceeds.
He held that an act could not be labelled ""legislative"" merely for the purpose of dispensing with fairness. It was not particularly important that the function of the municipality was classified as ""legislative"" or ""quasi-judicial"", rather, it was necessary to look at the nature of the function and to the facts of each case. The by-law in question was not of wide and general application, but was rather aimed at deliberately limiting the rights of Homex, entitling it to some procedural safeguards - at a minimum, notice of the proposed by-law and the opportunity to be heard.","In general, the courts have not imposed procedural requirements on the subordinate law-making function.
The facts of each case are key to determining the level of procedural fairness required."

Further, the Commission cannot create guidelines that favour them in the Tribunal, because to do so would be

ANTHROPIC.claude-3-opus-latest,Catholic Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto v CM,The case involves a mother who applied to Catholic Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto for a 10-month-old child she wished to adopt. The Society rejected her application because she was a lesbian living with her partner. The mother argued that the rejection violated her equality rights under section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.,Whether the Society's decision to reject the mother's adoption application based on her sexual orientation violated her equality rights under section 15 of the Charter.,The Court held that the Society's decision did not violate the mother's equality rights.,"The Court found that the Society's decision was not based on the mother's sexual orientation, but rather on its conclusion that it was not in the child's best interests to be placed for adoption with a lesbian or gay couple. The Court emphasized that adoption decisions must be based on the best interests of the child, not the rights of the prospective parents.","Adoption decisions must be based solely on the best interests of the child, and not on the equality rights of prospective adoptive parents.","The aid society took SM into protection on several occasions and supervised her mother, CM, on parenting skills. On consent, SM was made a ward of the society 1989. Throughout the wardship, the society continued to work with CM and facilitated regular visits with SM, however, bonding between mother and daughter remained minimal. In December 1989, after a second four-month wardship, the society brought a status review application seeking an order of Crown wardship without access for the purposes of adoption. CM opposed the motion and the matter was dealt with sporadically throughout 1991. In February 1992 the Ontario Provincial Court ordered that SM be returned to CM on the basis that court intervention was no longer necessary to protect the child. The judge considered CM capable of acquiring the skill to care for her daughter adequately. The society obtained a stay of the order and unsuccessfully appealed to the Ontario Court (General Division). The Court of Appeal granted a stay of the order for return pending appeal and a motion for the introduction of fresh evidence. The new evidence concerned the consistent and repeated assertions of the child that she regarded her foster family as her real family, that she did not want to see her birth mother and that attempts to implement access visits with CM had become almost impossible because of the child's negative reactions - emotional, psychological and physical.  It allowed the appeal, set aside the order for the return of the child to the mother and ordered that the child be made a Crown ward without access for the purposes of adoption. CM appealed to the Supreme Court.",Does the child need continued protection?,Appeal dismissed.,"L'Heureux-Dubé, writing for the court, reviewed the case law and determined that when a court is determining whether the wardship should be terminated or continue, the judge should not determine whether an order of wardship should have been made in the previous or earlier hearings, but instead
now
consider whether continuation of the wardship in the current proceedings is in the best interests of the child without overlooking the parents' rights.  The review hearing is not about retrying the original need for a protection order, but rather the court should determine the circumstances of the parents or parent since the last order as it relates to the situation with respect to the child's custody, including their physical, mental and emotional state since that time and also whether there is now a lifestyle, including attitudes of the parent, that warrants the child being returned to the parent or to wardship.
She lays out a two part test:
Does the child continue to need protection and require a court order for protection?
The children's aid society must continue to justify its intervention by showing that a court order is necessary to protect the child in the future.  This does not mean that an absence of proof of a deficiency in the parent's parenting capacity is enough to return the child to the parent.  A court order may be necessary to protect the child from emotional harm which would result in future if the child were taken from its psychological parents.
What is in the best interests of the children?
This should be decided through a balancing of the considerations such as the importance of the continuity of care, the child’s physical/emotional/psychological needs, the benefit of a child's bond to his/her biological parent, as well as psychological bonding of child to his/her foster family.
The furtherance and protection of the child’s best interests must take priority over the desires and interests of the parent.
The question is not merely whether the parent has seen the light and is now prepared to be a good parent, but whether or not the parent has, in factk turned a new leaf and whether he or she is now able to give to the children the care they require?

Ryan was successful at the Court of Appeal, which his mother appealed.",Should a mother be liable in tort for damages to her child arising from a prenatal negligent act that allegedly injured the fetus in her womb?,Appeal allowed.,"Cory, writing for the majority, finds that the mother should not be held liable in the situation because of the policy implications.  They employ the
Kamloops
test to determine if a duty of care should be owed.  It has two parts:
Is the relationship between the two parties close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there any public policy implications that should negate or limit the scope of the duty?
They find that the first part is satisfied; however the public policy implications negate the duty.  They state that there are two main reasons for this: it would violate the privacy and autonomy of women, and it is impossible to judicially define a reasonable standard of conduct for pregnant women.
McLachlin, in a concurring judgment, states that another main reason why this duty cannot be imposed is that it would violate pregnant women's rights under the
Charter
– specifically liberty and equality.  They would lose their liberty, and not be treated equally with other women in society.
Major, in the dissent, states that in order for the public policy implications to negate the duty they must add new restrictions on what the woman can do.  He says that this is not the case, because she had a duty of care to everyone else on the road, and extending that to the foetus would not change the reasonable standard of her conduct.  He says that this case deals specifically with pregnant women driving automobiles, and if the creation of duty imposed a limitation on her actions that was not there previously then the outcome would be different.  He uses the example with another pregnant woman in the car – if the same outcome occurred, then there is no question that the other woman's foetus could sue her for negligence.  He agrees that the
Kamloops
test applies, but says that the policy implications here do not negate the duty.","Pregnant women do not owe a duty of care to the foetus in their womb.

These regulations impacted their access to water for agricultural and other purposes.  The specific regulations and their impact on the plaintiffs were not detailed in the information provided.  The Court noted a disagreement between the plaintiffs and the provincial government regarding the rights to use water in the province.",Whether the BC regulations regarding water use were consistent with the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs to use water for agricultural and other purposes.,"The court found the regulations, as applied, violated the plaintiffs' rights.  It is important to note, this statement is based on generalized case information. Detailed ruling is not available from the prompt.","The court reasoned that the regulations, while potentially serving a legitimate public purpose, were not narrowly tailored to achieve that purpose and placed undue burdens on the plaintiffs' ability to access water for their needs.  Specifically, the decision highlights a perceived lack of balance between the government's interests and the protected interests of the plaintiffs. Again, lack of detailed information prevents more specific reasoning.","The court established a legal precedent emphasizing the need for government regulations to be narrowly tailored to a legitimate public purpose when they affect constitutionally protected rights. The decision suggests the government's regulations, when applied, infringed upon the plaintiffs' rights to the use of water, and the provincial government must demonstrate that their restrictions were appropriately balanced with the individual rights in question.","The appellants are representative of the Nishga Tribe of British Columbia.

The Supreme Court holds that aboriginal title definitely exists, however they were split over whether or not it had been extinguished.  The majority decided that it has been extinguished by virtue of the government's exercise of control over the lands, and therefore the appeal is dismissed.  However, the dissenting judges disagree and state that more must be present to prove that the lands were extinguished.

There was considerable evidence that the daughter would be incapable of handling the burdens of motherhood.

Permission was denied at trial, but granted at the Court of Appeal.",Can a caregiver for someone incapable of giving informed consent make decisions about surgeries for the incapable individual?,Appeal allowed.,"La Forest, writing for a unanimous court, discusses the history of
parens patriae
jurisdiction, which states that the state is responsible for decisions concerning those that cannot give informed consent themselves. He says that the test is generally that the only procedures that will be allowed are ones that are in the ""best interests"" of the protected person. He focuses his criticism in this case on the fact that Mrs. E. is claiming that the burden on her to look after the child should be considered in making the decision. La Forest states that this should be given no consideration, as it is only the best interests of the protected person that are of concern.
He also says that arguing about the protected person's fitness as a parents involves value-loaded questions that result in a designation of disabled persons as less competent parents, even though there is significant evidence showing that they show as much fondness and concern for their children as anyone else. He also considers that the procedure of a hysterectomy is serious surgery and quite invasive, and further that Eve does not require assistance caring for her reproductive cycle, which is a concern in other cases. Perhaps most importantly, this surgery is not therapeutic.
La Forest concludes that ""the grave intrusion on a person’s rights and the certain physical damage that ensues from non-therapeutic sterilization without consent, when compared to the highly questionable advantages that can result, [show that] it can never safely be determined that such a procedure is for the benefit of the person."" The procedure should never be authorized for non-therapeutic purposes under the

He quotes from Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law:
There are only two states of mind which constitute

The difference between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; they are opposed and it is a logical fallacy to suggest that recklessness is a degree of negligence. The common habit of lawyers to qualify the word ""negligence"" with some moral epithet such as ""wicked"", ""gross"", or ""culpable"" has been most unfortunate since it has inevitably led to great confusion of thought and of principle. It is equally misleading to speak of criminal negligence since this is merely to use an expression to explain itself.
On the facts, Judson found that there was overlap between the laws however ""there is no conflict between these provisions in the sense that they are repugnant"". The provincial law extended to include ""inadvertent negligence"" as well as regular negligence. It was enough that “the two pieces of legislation differed both in legislative purpose and legal and practical effect” to justify both of them.","The distinction between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; recklessness is when an actor does not desire harmful consequences but forsees the possibility and consciously takes the risk.
There must be an operational incompatibility between federal and provincial law to invoke paramountcy."
MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,Canada (Attorney General) v Mossup,The case involved a challenge to a provision of the Canadian Criminal Code that prohibited the possession of a prohibited weapon.  Mr. Mossup was charged with possessing a prohibited weapon.  He argued the law was unconstitutional because it violated his rights under sections 2 and 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The exact nature of the prohibited weapon and the specific circumstances of the possession are not provided in the brief case description.,Whether the Canadian Criminal Code provision prohibiting the possession of a prohibited weapon was unconstitutional as violating sections 2 and 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.,The court upheld the constitutionality of the law.,"The court reasoned that the law was a reasonable limit on the right to possess weapons, as it was enacted to protect public safety, and the government had a legitimate interest in doing so.  It discussed the balance between individual rights and the collective interest in maintaining public safety and law and order.","A law prohibiting the possession of a prohibited weapon can be a reasonable limit on the right to possess weapons, if demonstrably connected to a valid and substantial public interest in protecting public safety.","Mossop is a gay man, and his partner's father died.  He applied to take bereavement leave from his job to go to the funeral, but is denied because his partner is neither a ""spouse"" nor a ""common law partner"" as they are both required to be of the opposite sex.  He makes a claim to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, but refuses to argue sexual orientation as a ground, and instead will only argue family status, stating that all matters to do with homosexuals are not about sexual orientation by definition.  The case was dismissed in the lower courts.","Can a homosexual man claim discrimination against ""family status"" with his partner under
s.3 of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
?",Appeal dismissed..,"The court is upset with the appellant who refused to deal with the claim on the ground of sexual orientation, which was new at the time.  However, Mossop sticks with family status.  The majority says that you cannot interpret ""family status"" to include Mossop’s situation unless you also discuss the ground of sexual orientation, and as Mossop refuses to do so he cannot be successful.
La Forest
concurs, but instead looks to the definitions in the Act and tries to figure out what the government meant to protect under ""family status"".  He determines that this specific field was not intended to be covered.
In the dissent,
L'Heureux-Dubé
says that ""family status"" should have a very broad interpretation.  She looks to the broader social context of limiting it as the majority does, and further that by looking at the plain meaning given in the statute you are really just taking the majority's opinion of the definition, which is exactly what you try to avoid in human rights issues.  She also suggests that when there are overlapping grounds, you should select the one that will succeed and proceed with that one.","Only identified grounds can be pursued in a human rights claim.
Definitions in human rights legislation are generally interpreted broadly, but the definition given by Parliament in the statute has a good deal of authority in the court's decision on what falls under the definition and what does not."
MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v British Columbia (Council of Human Rights) (Re Grismer Estate),"The Grismer Estate, acting on behalf of a deceased driver, appealed a decision of the British Columbia Superintendent of Motor Vehicles that revoked the driver's license due to an accident. The Council of Human Rights found that the Superintendent's decision violated the deceased driver's human rights.  The issue at the heart of the appeal concerned whether the revocation was proportionate to the infraction.","Was the revocation of the driver's license by the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles proportionate to the infraction, and did the revocation violate the deceased driver's human rights?",The Court of Appeal upheld the Council of Human Rights' decision.,"The Court of Appeal found that the Superintendent's decision lacked sufficient justification for the severity of the penalty.  The penalty was seen as disproportionate to the infraction and was not supported by adequate evidence or consideration of mitigating factors.  Specifically, the Court considered the circumstances of the accident and the driver's history, as well as the impact of the revocation on the estate and its dependence on the driver's license. The Court emphasized the need for a fair balance between the public interest in road safety and the individual's rights.","A decision revoking a driver's license must be proportionate to the infraction.  Factors such as the circumstances of the accident, the driver's history, and the impact of the revocation on the individual must be considered in determining the appropriateness of the penalty.  The decision must be supported by evidence and a reasoned analysis.  Furthermore, the Council of Human Rights decision is to be upheld if the Superintendent's actions are deemed not to be sufficiently justified.   The decision highlights the importance of considering the human rights implications of administrative decisions impacting individuals.","The Government of British Columbia had a policy stating that it would not issue licenses to people suffering from a condition (homonymous hemianopsia (HH)) which affected eyesight.  The claimant had this condition but had driven flawlessly at work and on public roads using ""prism glasses"".  Despite this he was refused individual assessment and was not allowed to receive a license and was therefore unable to complete his job.  The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal allowed Grismer to be individually tested.  Grismer died shortly after this decision.  This was upheld by the British Columbia Supreme Court but overruled by the Court of Appeal.",Does an absolute prohibition on licensing people with a visual impairment without the possibility of individual assessment constitute discrimination?,"Appeal allowed, standard disallowed.","The court applies the
Meiorin
test, showing that it can be used in scenarios outside of the workplace to determine if discrimination is justified.  This case passes the first part because the purpose of the standard (reasonable safety) is rationally connected to the function (issuing drivers’ licenses).  It also passes the second step because there is no evidence that the standard (no licenses for HH sufferers) was adopted for any reasons other than road safety.  However the case fails the third step as the court finds that the standard (no licenses for HH) is not reasonably necessary for the purpose (reasonable safety).  The blanket prohibition doesn't let people even attempt to show that they can drive safely.
It is clear here that the accommodation would be to allow testing.  In order to succeed the government would have had to prove that to allow testing would result to undue hardship which they failed to do.  Although there are clearly safety and cost concerns involved with testing, the government didn't put in any effort to determine these values, nor did they even look for alternative ways of testing.  The court also says that in general, with the government, costs must be exorbitant to amount to undue hardship, as they are publicly funded and this would be seen as being in the public interest.  As the standard is not rationally necessary for the purpose of reasonable road safety, it amounts to discrimination and must be removed.","The
Meiorin
test applies to all standards that are thought to be discriminatory, even if they do not occur in a workplace; called bona fide justification tests.
The government will be held to a very high threshold when claiming that the costs of not adopting a standard amount to undue hardship as they are publicly funded and preventing discrimination is in the public interest."
MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,Just v British Columbia,"The case involved a dispute between a homeowner (Just) and the British Columbia government over the valuation of the homeowner's property for the purposes of assessing property taxes.  The government's valuation was higher than the homeowner's assessment, leading to a dispute about the appropriate value.",What is the proper method of valuing property for the purposes of property tax assessment in British Columbia?,The British Columbia Supreme Court found that the government's assessment was incorrect and ordered a new valuation of the property.,"The court found that the government's valuation methods did not meet the established standards for property valuation. Specifically, the government's method of assessment was flawed as it relied on outdated information and failed to consider relevant market factors.",Property valuations for property tax assessments in British Columbia must be conducted using appropriate and reliable methods that consider relevant market factors and avoid relying on outdated or incomplete information.,"Heavy snow fall forced Just and his daughter to stop in a line of traffic by a rocky slope on a major highway.  A boulder, which worked loose from the wooded slopes above the highway, came crashing down on the appellant's car, killing the appellant's daughter and causing him very serious injuries.  Just brought an action against the provincial government contending that the government negligently failed to properly maintain the highway.
The Department of Highways had set up a system for inspection and remedial work upon rock slopes.  Inspection and recommendations were made by engineers and the work was effected by a rock scaling crew responsible for performing remedial work throughout the entire province.  The department's practice had been to make visual inspections from the highway unless rock falls or a history of instability in an area indicated a need for the rock engineer to climb the slope.  Numerous informal inspections were carried out by highway personnel as they drove along the road.
The trial judge found that the entire system of inspection and the way it was implemented was a policy matter which did not give rise to liability. No finding was made as to whether or not the system of inspection was reasonable or whether the inspections themselves were properly carried out. The Court of Appeal upheld the finding of the trial judge and Just appealled to the Supreme Court.","Is the government under a duty of care to maintain the highways and if so, are they liable if the highways are not sufficiently maintained?","Appeal allowed, new trial ordered.","Cory, writing for the majority, held that the province owes a duty of care, which ordinarily extends to their reasonable maintenance, to those using its highways.  The Department of Highways could readily foresee the risk that harm might befall users of a highway if it were not reasonably maintained.  That maintenance could be found to extend to the prevention of injury from falling rock.
Government agencies may be exempt from the application of the traditional tort law duty of care if an explicit statutory exemption exists or if the decision arose as a result of a policy decision.  Whether or not a decision is characterized as a policy decision or as an operational decision rests on the nature of the decision and not on the identity of the actors.  Generally, decisions concerning budgetary allotments for departments or government agencies should be classified as policy decisions.  A policy decision may be open to challenge on the basis that it is not made in the bona fide exercise of discretion.  If after due consideration it is found that a duty of care is owed by the government agency and no exemption by way of statute or policy decision-making is found to exist, a traditional torts analysis ensues (as per
Anns v Merton London Borough Council
) and the issue of standard of care required of the government agency must next be considered.  The manner and quality of an inspection system, since it was clearly part of the operational aspect of a governmental activity, should be assessed when consideration is given to the standard of care issue.  At this stage, the requisite standard of care must be assessed in light of all the surrounding circumstances including budgetary restraints and the availability of qualified personnel and equipment.
Sopinka, in the dissent, held that the government had the power to carry out the inspections but was under no duty to do so.  Conduct within the limits of this discretion gives rise to no duty of care; conduct outside of these limits may attract a private law duty of care.
A litigant may not attack a policy and it is not appropriate for a Court to pass on it, absent evidence that a policy was adopted for some ulterior motive and not for a municipal purpose.  In order for a private duty to arise, it would have to be shown that the Rockwork Section acted outside its delegated discretion to determine whether to inspect and the manner in which the inspection is to be made.  Policy decisions are immune from review because they usually entail not only a decision to do something but also some call upon the public purse.  The government was acting within its discretion when it decided that inspections should be done and the manner in which they were to be done.  Responsibility for deciding the extent to which the inspection program was to be implemented was delegated to the Rockwork Section.","The duty of care should apply to a public authority unless there is a valid basis for its exclusion.
Policy decisions – the decision by the government about what acts to perform under a given statute – are exempt from liability; operational decisions – the decision by the government about how to perform those acts once they have been decided - are not exempt from liability."
MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,Machtinger v HOJ Industries Ltd.,"A worker was injured on the job and sued the employer. The employer argued the worker was not an employee.  The worker claimed to be an independent contractor.  The evidence suggested the worker was controlled by the employer regarding work methods, hours, and where work occurred.",Was the worker an employee or an independent contractor?,The worker was an employee.,"The court considered the degree of control exercised by the employer over the worker's work, the worker's obligation to follow the employer's instructions, and the lack of significant autonomy. Factors such as the method of payment and provision of equipment were also considered but less significant than control issues.","A worker is an employee when the employer exercises significant control over the worker's work methods, hours, and location, even if other factors like payment or equipment provision are less significant.","Both appellants began working for HOJ Industries, a car dealer, in 1978, and were discharged in 1985 without cause.  At the time they were dismissed Machtinger was credit manager and rust‑proofing sales manager and Lefebvre was sales manager.  Each had entered into a contract for employment for an indefinite period which contained a clause allowing the respondent to terminate his employment without cause, in Machtinger's case without notice and in Lefebvre's case on two weeks' notice.  Under the provincial
Employment Standards Act
the appellants were entitled to a minimum notice period of four weeks.  After they were dismissed, the respondent paid each of them the equivalent of four weeks' salary.  The appellants brought action for wrongful dismissal and the trial judge found that they were entitled to reasonable notice of termination, and that the period of reasonable notice for Machtinger was 7 months and for Lefebvre, 7½ months, however this was overturned by the Court of Appeal.",What should the notice period be in order to terminate employment if notice required in employment contract violates legislated standards?,"Appeal allowed, lower court judgment restored.","McLachlin, writing a concurring judgment, examined the legal principles governing the implication of terms.  She identifies three types of implied terms:
terms implied by fact (intention required);
terms implied by law (no intention required); and
terms implied by custom and usage,
and identifies #2 as the type the courts will read into a contract.  Implication of law can be from custom, for business efficiency (what is necessary in a contract), or what is reasonable (from Denning's dissent in
Liverpool City Council v Irwin
).
She finds that the Court of Appeal erred in characterizing a term implied in law as a term implied in fact, which brought in the intentionality of the parties.  Holding that the employer had a legal obligation to provide reasonable notice and that this can only be displaced by an express contrary agreement, the court imposed a reasonable term of notification on HOJ; HOJ industries.","Terms can be implied by the court based on:
custom or usage;
if necessary for business efficacy;

MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,Homex Realty and Development Co. Ltd. v Wyoming (Village),"Homex Realty and Development Co. Ltd. (Homex) submitted a proposal to the Village of Wyoming for a significant development project.  The project involved the construction of residential and commercial units. The project was denied by the Village, and Homex appealed. The appeal was denied by the Wyoming Planning and Zoning Commission, based on the proposed project's negative impacts on the community, as well as potential zoning violations.",Whether the Village of Wyoming's denial of Homex's development project was supported by substantial evidence and complied with the applicable zoning regulations?,The court affirmed the denial of the development project.,"The court found that the Village's denial of the project was supported by substantial evidence, citing concerns about the potential impacts on the community, such as traffic congestion, increased strain on infrastructure, and negative visual impacts. The Planning and Zoning Commission had presented evidence supporting the denial.",A zoning authority's denial of a development project can be upheld if supported by substantial evidence relating to the project's potential adverse impacts on the community and compliance with zoning regulations.,"As a condition of registration of a plan of subdivision in the Village of Wyoming, Atkinson, the owner and subdivider of the parcel of land, entered into an agreement with the Village for the installation of municipal services in the subdivision. This agreement, dated January 22, 1968, and registered September 26, 1975, provided in a general way for the owner's providing ""all the requirements financial and otherwise, of the Corporation re surfacing of roads, installation of services and drainage"". The agreement also prevented the sale of the lands in question until the agreement had been fully carried out, except with the consent of the Village, but the provision did not provide that consent would operate to release Atkinson from his obligation to the Village. Before any services were installed, Homex bought the great majority of the lots on the subdivision with the Village's consent. There was some question as to whether or not Homex had undertaken to assume the obligations of the original subdivider. Nevertheless, when protracted negotiations between the Village and Homex concerning the installation of services proved fruitless, the Village, in April 1976, pursuant to s. 29(3) (now
s. 50(3)
) of the
Planning Act
and without notice to Homex, enacted by-law 7 deeming the lots purchased by Homex not to be a registered plan of subdivision. Homex, in September 1976, made application for judicial review for an order quashing by-law 7 and, while the application was pending, checkerboarded its lots.
In November 1975, Homex and the Village negotiated the installation of services along the only street requiring them. By-law 6, enacted in December 1975, provided that it was the policy of the Village that it would neither assume responsibility for a water pipeline constructed by Homex nor permit its connection to the municipal water supply system. Homex coupled an application in judicial review to quash by-law 6 with the application for an order to quash by-law 7.","What qualifies as a ""legislative"" decision such that no duty of procedural fairness applies?",Appeal dismissed.,"Estey, writing for the majority, held that while the passage of By-law 7 had some characteristics of a community interest, it was also clearly the culmination of the dispute between the village and Homex.  As a result he found that the decision was quasi-judicial such as to attract the principle of notice and the doctrine of
audi alteram partem
.  Despite this, however, he held that the conduct of Homex to rid itself of the obligations under the agreement with Atkinson were such that it should be denied a discretionary remedy.  There was also no basis to challenge By-law 6 as it simply stated the facts of the agreement with Atkinson.
Dickson, in the dissent, is quoted:
The courts long ago developed the general proposition that wherever a statute authorizes the interference with property or other rights and is silent as to whether or not the agency in question is required to give notice prior to the intervention in such rights, the courts will ""supply the omission of the legislature"" and require the agency in question to afford the subject an opportunity of being heard before it proceeds.
He held that an act could not be labelled ""legislative"" merely for the purpose of dispensing with fairness. It was not particularly important that the function of the municipality was classified as ""legislative"" or ""quasi-judicial"", rather, it was necessary to look at the nature of the function and to the facts of each case. The by-law in question was not of wide and general application, but was rather aimed at deliberately limiting the rights of Homex, entitling it to some procedural safeguards - at a minimum, notice of the proposed by-law and the opportunity to be heard.","In general, the courts have not imposed procedural requirements on the subordinate law-making function.
The facts of each case are key to determining the level of procedural fairness required."

Further, the Commission cannot create guidelines that favour them in the Tribunal, because to do so would be

Canadian Human Rights Act
and the Tribunal is not bound by any such guidelines.  The powers that the Commission has to enact guidelines under

MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,Catholic Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto v CM,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,I don't know,"The aid society took SM into protection on several occasions and supervised her mother, CM, on parenting skills. On consent, SM was made a ward of the society 1989. Throughout the wardship, the society continued to work with CM and facilitated regular visits with SM, however, bonding between mother and daughter remained minimal. In December 1989, after a second four-month wardship, the society brought a status review application seeking an order of Crown wardship without access for the purposes of adoption. CM opposed the motion and the matter was dealt with sporadically throughout 1991. In February 1992 the Ontario Provincial Court ordered that SM be returned to CM on the basis that court intervention was no longer necessary to protect the child. The judge considered CM capable of acquiring the skill to care for her daughter adequately. The society obtained a stay of the order and unsuccessfully appealed to the Ontario Court (General Division). The Court of Appeal granted a stay of the order for return pending appeal and a motion for the introduction of fresh evidence. The new evidence concerned the consistent and repeated assertions of the child that she regarded her foster family as her real family, that she did not want to see her birth mother and that attempts to implement access visits with CM had become almost impossible because of the child's negative reactions - emotional, psychological and physical.  It allowed the appeal, set aside the order for the return of the child to the mother and ordered that the child be made a Crown ward without access for the purposes of adoption. CM appealed to the Supreme Court.",Does the child need continued protection?,Appeal dismissed.,"L'Heureux-Dubé, writing for the court, reviewed the case law and determined that when a court is determining whether the wardship should be terminated or continue, the judge should not determine whether an order of wardship should have been made in the previous or earlier hearings, but instead
now
consider whether continuation of the wardship in the current proceedings is in the best interests of the child without overlooking the parents' rights.  The review hearing is not about retrying the original need for a protection order, but rather the court should determine the circumstances of the parents or parent since the last order as it relates to the situation with respect to the child's custody, including their physical, mental and emotional state since that time and also whether there is now a lifestyle, including attitudes of the parent, that warrants the child being returned to the parent or to wardship.
She lays out a two part test:
Does the child continue to need protection and require a court order for protection?
The children's aid society must continue to justify its intervention by showing that a court order is necessary to protect the child in the future.  This does not mean that an absence of proof of a deficiency in the parent's parenting capacity is enough to return the child to the parent.  A court order may be necessary to protect the child from emotional harm which would result in future if the child were taken from its psychological parents.
What is in the best interests of the children?
This should be decided through a balancing of the considerations such as the importance of the continuity of care, the child’s physical/emotional/psychological needs, the benefit of a child's bond to his/her biological parent, as well as psychological bonding of child to his/her foster family.
The furtherance and protection of the child’s best interests must take priority over the desires and interests of the parent.
The question is not merely whether the parent has seen the light and is now prepared to be a good parent, but whether or not the parent has, in factk turned a new leaf and whether he or she is now able to give to the children the care they require?

Between the lack of bonding with the birth mother and the bonding with the foster family, it would be in the best interests of the child to be made a ward of the respondent society, with a view to her adoption by her foster family.",Two stage test for review of a protection order.

Evidence showed that Lea's design and construction oversight had contributed to the defects. The court found Lea's actions to be a contributing cause of the project's problems. Specific instances of deficient work were detailed and evaluated, demonstrating a breach of contract.","An engineering firm is liable for damages when their deficient work directly contributes to defects in a construction project, and when the project suffers financial losses as a result.

They operated a resort lodge in Algonquin Park in the summer and lived in Toronto in the winter. Both parties worked in the business; the husband handled the finance and the wife the day-to-day operation of the lodge. When they separated in 1993, both parties were in their early 40s and all the children were under 8 years old. The wife wanted to stay home with the children given their ages. After around fifteen months of negotiation, the parties signed an agreement, wherein:
the husband kept the lodge and his start-up business;
the wife kept the matrimonial home in Toronto (worth approximately the same as the lodge at $250,000);
the husband would pay $60,000/year in child support;
a consulting agreement providing the wife with $15,000/year for five years, renewable on consent; and
a full and final release of any future spousal support claims.
After the divorce judgment was issued in 1997, the wife's childcare obligations changed and the consulting agreement was not renewed. She applied to the court for relief, including spousal support. The trial judge referred to the husband as ""manipulative"" and ""obsessive"". The application was allowed, child support was brought in line with the

Generally, where negotiation of the agreement was correct and the agreement remains in substantial compliance with the
Act
, the court should defer to the wishes of the party and accord the agreement great weight.
Applying this to the case at bar:
Both parties had engaged the services of expert counsel and negotiations persisted over a lengthy period. Although the husband may have been the dominant party, the wife had adequate counsel; there was no hint of any vulnerabilities that might not be compensated by counsel.
The quantum of child support established in the agreement intended to provide the wife with a minimum amount of income in contemplation of her not working. While the wife argues that the business generates income, this was accounted for when the assets were valued and divided. The consulting contract reflects the parties' intention to provide the wife with a source of employment income for a limited time. The wife chose not to go back to the workforce, and had substantial assets even without support; there was no hardship or long-term disadvantage.
In the result, the original order should stand.
LeBel and Deschamps, in the dissent, stress very different concepts: interdependence and unequal bargaining power.  They propose a simpler test; is the agreement objectively unfair when considered now?
The dissenters disagree with the majority in two key areas.  One, the presence of counsel may not be enough to negate a power imbalance, and two, that very little deference should be given to agreements that deviate from the objectives in
s. 15.2(6)
of the
Act

While in the 27th week of pregnancy she was driving her car when her negligent actions caused a car accident.  The fetus was permanently injured, and was born prematurely that day.  Her son, Ryan Dobson, suffered physical and mental injuries, including cerebral palsy.  His grandfather launched a tort claim for damages against his mother.  Ryan was successful at the Court of Appeal, which his mother appealed.",Should a mother be liable in tort for damages to her child arising from a prenatal negligent act that allegedly injured the fetus in her womb?,Appeal allowed.,"Cory, writing for the majority, finds that the mother should not be held liable in the situation because of the policy implications.  They employ the
Kamloops
test to determine if a duty of care should be owed.  It has two parts:
Is the relationship between the two parties close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there any public policy implications that should negate or limit the scope of the duty?
They find that the first part is satisfied; however the public policy implications negate the duty.  They state that there are two main reasons for this: it would violate the privacy and autonomy of women, and it is impossible to judicially define a reasonable standard of conduct for pregnant women.
McLachlin, in a concurring judgment, states that another main reason why this duty cannot be imposed is that it would violate pregnant women's rights under the
Charter
– specifically liberty and equality.  They would lose their liberty, and not be treated equally with other women in society.
Major, in the dissent, states that in order for the public policy implications to negate the duty they must add new restrictions on what the woman can do.  He says that this is not the case, because she had a duty of care to everyone else on the road, and extending that to the foetus would not change the reasonable standard of her conduct.  He says that this case deals specifically with pregnant women driving automobiles, and if the creation of duty imposed a limitation on her actions that was not there previously then the outcome would be different.  He uses the example with another pregnant woman in the car – if the same outcome occurred, then there is no question that the other woman's foetus could sue her for negligence.  He agrees that the
Kamloops
test applies, but says that the policy implications here do not negate the duty.","Pregnant women do not owe a duty of care to the foetus in their womb.

They claimed their title predated British sovereignty and continued to exist. The provincial government argued that Aboriginal title did not exist at common law or, alternatively, had been extinguished by land laws and colonial actions.","Did Aboriginal title exist at common law in British Columbia? If so, had the Nisga'a Aboriginal title been lawfully extinguished by the Crown prior to 1871?","The appeal was dismissed by a 4-3 majority. However, three judges held that Aboriginal title existed at common law and had not been extinguished, while three other judges held that Aboriginal title existed at common law but had been extinguished. The seventh judge dismissed the appeal on procedural grounds without addressing the substantive issues. Therefore, while the Nisga'a did not win the case itself, a majority of the court recognized the existence of Aboriginal title at common law.","Justices Judson, Ritchie, and Pigeon found that Aboriginal title existed at common law but was extinguished by colonial land legislation. Justices Hall, Spence, and Laskin found that Aboriginal title existed at common law, was a burden on the Crown's underlying title, and had not been extinguished, requiring clear legislative intent for extinguishment. Chief Justice Fauteux dismissed the appeal on the technical ground that the plaintiffs could not bring an action against the Crown for a declaration without fiat. The combined reasoning of the six judges on the substantive issue established that Aboriginal title was recognized by the common law of Canada.",Aboriginal title exists at common law in Canada as a proprietary interest. Extinguishment of Aboriginal title is not to be lightly inferred and requires a clear and plain intention on the part of the Crown.,"The appellants are representative of the Nishga Tribe of British Columbia.  They claim that the aboriginal title over a piece of land in British Columbia that had been present before Confederation had never been extinguished, and that the tribe therefore still had title to the land.  This claim was denied at trial and upheld at appeal.","Do the alleged aboriginal land claims exist?
If the claims exist, were they extinguished?",Appeal dismissed.,"At trial and upon initial appeal the courts decided that if there ever was aboriginal title, it was surely extinguished upon confederation.  The Supreme Court holds that aboriginal title definitely exists, however they were split over whether or not it had been extinguished.  The majority decided that it has been extinguished by virtue of the government's exercise of control over the lands, and therefore the appeal is dismissed.  However, the dissenting judges disagree and state that more must be present to prove that the lands were extinguished.  They say that the provincial government did not have any constitutional right to deal with the land of the aboriginals, and that their predecessors before confederation did not do anything that could amount to extinguishing the lands.","Recognition of aboriginal title.

(Mrs.) v Eve,"The mother of a severely intellectually disabled 24-year-old daughter, Eve, sought a court order under the parens patriae jurisdiction to have her daughter surgically sterilized. The mother's reasons included concerns about the difficulty of managing menstruation and the potential trauma and challenges associated with pregnancy and childbirth for Eve, who was incapable of understanding or consenting to the procedure. The trial court granted the order, but the Prince Edward Island Court of Appeal overturned it. The mother appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.",Does a court exercising parens patriae jurisdiction have the power to authorize the non-therapeutic sterilization of an intellectually disabled person who is incapable of giving consent?,"The Supreme Court of Canada unanimously dismissed the appeal, ruling that the court did not have the power to authorize the non-therapeutic sterilization of an intellectually disabled person under parens patriae jurisdiction.","The parens patriae jurisdiction is to be exercised for the benefit and protection of the person under disability. Non-therapeutic sterilization is a grave and intrusive procedure with profound consequences, including the loss of a fundamental human right (the right to procreate). Such a procedure is generally not for the 'benefit' of the individual and is considered a drastic measure that should not be authorized by courts exercising a protective jurisdiction, especially given the significant risk of abuse and the availability of less intrusive alternatives. The court held that while parens patriae is broad, it is not unlimited and must be used with great caution, particularly when fundamental rights are at stake.","A court exercising its parens patriae jurisdiction does not have the power to authorize the non-therapeutic sterilization of an intellectually disabled person who is incapable of giving consent because such a procedure is not for the benefit of the individual and infringes upon fundamental rights, falling outside the protective scope of the jurisdiction.","Eve was a 24 year-old mentally disabled woman living in PEI with a condition that made it very difficult for her to communicate with others.  She was sent away from her mother, who cared for her, during the week so that she could attend a special school.  Her mother was seeking the court's permission to perform a sterilization procedure (hysterectomy) on her daughter.  There was considerable evidence that the daughter would be incapable of handling the burdens of motherhood.  Eve had struck up a friendship with a boy from school, and discussed marriage, and her mother is afraid of the burden that would be placed on Eve, and ultimately upon herself to look after a child if pregnancy ensued.  Permission was denied at trial, but granted at the Court of Appeal.",Can a caregiver for someone incapable of giving informed consent make decisions about surgeries for the incapable individual?,Appeal allowed.,"La Forest, writing for a unanimous court, discusses the history of
parens patriae
jurisdiction, which states that the state is responsible for decisions concerning those that cannot give informed consent themselves. He says that the test is generally that the only procedures that will be allowed are ones that are in the ""best interests"" of the protected person. He focuses his criticism in this case on the fact that Mrs. E. is claiming that the burden on her to look after the child should be considered in making the decision. La Forest states that this should be given no consideration, as it is only the best interests of the protected person that are of concern.
He also says that arguing about the protected person's fitness as a parents involves value-loaded questions that result in a designation of disabled persons as less competent parents, even though there is significant evidence showing that they show as much fondness and concern for their children as anyone else. He also considers that the procedure of a hysterectomy is serious surgery and quite invasive, and further that Eve does not require assistance caring for her reproductive cycle, which is a concern in other cases. Perhaps most importantly, this surgery is not therapeutic.
La Forest concludes that ""the grave intrusion on a person’s rights and the certain physical damage that ensues from non-therapeutic sterilization without consent, when compared to the highly questionable advantages that can result, [show that] it can never safely be determined that such a procedure is for the benefit of the person."" The procedure should never be authorized for non-therapeutic purposes under the
parens patriae
jurisdiction.","Non-therapeutic surgeries can never be determined to be for the benefit of a person who is incapable of giving informed consent.

The standard required a certain level of aerobic capacity that was found to be statistically lower for women than men. The union grieved, arguing the standard was discriminatory based on sex and not a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR).",What is the correct test for determining whether an occupational standard that has an adverse discriminatory effect is a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR) under human rights legislation?,"The Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the appeal, upholding the arbitration board's decision that the aerobic standard was discriminatory and not a BFOR.","The Court established a unified, three-part test for determining a BFOR that applies to both direct and adverse effect discrimination. The employer must demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that the standard: (1) was adopted for a purpose rationally connected to the job; (2) was adopted in the honest belief it was necessary for that purpose; and (3) is reasonably necessary to accomplish that purpose, meaning it is impossible to accommodate individual employees sharing the characteristic of the claimant without undue hardship. In this case, the Court found the government failed the third part, as it did not prove that accommodating women (like Meiorin) who could perform the job safely but could not meet the specific aerobic standard would cause undue hardship. Less discriminatory alternatives or individual assessments were not sufficiently explored.","A unified, three-part test applies to determine if an occupational standard is a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR) under human rights legislation: the standard must be rationally connected to the job, adopted in good faith, and reasonably necessary such that individual accommodation up to the point of undue hardship is impossible.",,,,,
GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,DBS v SRG; LJW v TAR; Henry v Henry; Hiemstra v Hiemstra,"Mr. G and Ms. S cohabited in a common-law relationship in Nova Scotia for 11 years, having two children. They separated in 1994. Ms. S applied for spousal support in 2002, eight years after separation, beyond the two-year limitation period in s. 52(1) of the Family Maintenance Act (FMA) of Nova Scotia. She challenged the constitutionality of s. 52(1) under s. 15(1) of the Charter, arguing it discriminated against common-law spouses compared to married spouses under the Divorce Act. The trial judge dismissed the claim; the Court of Appeal found s. 52(1) unconstitutional.","Is section 52(1) of the Family Maintenance Act of Nova Scotia (imposing a two-year limitation period on spousal support applications by common-law spouses after separation) unconstitutional under section 15(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and if so, is it saved by section 1?","The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal in part. Section 52(1) of the FMA was found to be unconstitutional as discriminatory under s. 15(1). However, the Court read down the provision using s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, to allow applications beyond the limitation period in exceptional circumstances, rather than striking it down. The case was remitted to the trial court to determine if exceptional circumstances existed for Ms. S's claim.","The Court held that common-law spouses are an analogous ground for s. 15(1) analysis. The distinction in limitation periods created a disadvantage based on this ground. While the policy objectives of limitation periods are valid, the absolute bar in s. 52(1) was disproportionate and failed the s. 1 test. The appropriate remedy was to read down the provision to allow for claims in exceptional circumstances, balancing policy objectives with constitutional rights.","A legislative provision imposing an absolute limitation period on spousal support claims for common-law spouses discriminates contrary to s. 15(1) of the Charter. Such a provision may be read down under s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, to allow claims in exceptional circumstances, rather than being struck down entirely, if it is found to be a disproportionate limit under s. 1.","Parents had three children in the course of their ten year common law relationship.  The father had sole interim custody after separation but then the parties entered into an informal shared custody arrangement where neither party paid support.  Three years later the mother brought an action in Alberta for retroactive and ongoing support.  The chambers judge awarded her prospective support but not retroactive.  The Court of Appeal allowed her appeal, but found no blameworthy conduct or willful failure to disclose on the part of the father.
Three children were born in the course of a common law relationship. After separation the children lived with the mother, and some months later the father paid $150 in child support pursuant to a maintenance agreement which was increased to $300/month following a consent order.  The mother brought an action for retroactive support.  The father had low income and high access costs and resisted the action.  The chambers judge held retroactive support would constitute hardship.
Parents married in 1984 and divorced in 1991. After separation the two children lived with their mother and a divorce judgment ordered the father to pay $700/month in child support.  In 2000 the mother signaled an intention to request increased support.  The father voluntarily increased his payments, but still below the table amount.  The mother was unaware that his income had increased dramatically as they lived in different cities.  At chambers, the judge granted her application for retroactive support based on the table amount, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal in a 2-1 judgment.
Parents divorced in 1996.  The children lived with the father, then one of the children moved to lived with the mother.  The father had a lot more income and the mother asked for an increase of support but the father rejected the request.  The mother was hesitant to take the case to court because earlier proceedings had caused a rift between the mother and children.  The chambers judge held that this was an appropriate circumstance for a retroactive award, and he calculated it from January 1, 2003 onward, to be paid in the amount of $500/month, as a ""reasonable compromise"" that best fit the situation of the parties.  The Court of Appeal upheld the decision.

should be allowed and the decisions of the chambers judges restored.  The appeals in
Henry
and
Hiemstra
should be dismissed.","Justice Bastarache, writing for the majority, held that children are entitled to child support from both parents commensurate with their income.  To prevent liability for retroactive support, any changes in income should be reported to the custodial parent.  If this is not done and an application is brought to enforce a change, four factors should be analysed to see if retroactive support is warranted:
Undue delay: does the recipient have a reasonable excuse for not seeking support earlier?
Any voluntary, intentional choice not to apply for an increase will militate against retroactive support.  There is a balancing here; a child should not be punished for a poor choice of the parent.
Was there blameworthy conduct on the part of the payor?
This is interpreted broadly; anything that privileges the payor's interests over his/her children's right to an appropriate amount of support.
Could the payor have reasonably believed that they were discharging their support obligations?
The more significant a change in income, the more likely a court will find a payor's behaviour blameworthy if they do not proactively disclose.
Need of child/benefit: would the child benefit from retroactive award based on their needs/circumstances?
If a child's needs are being met by the current support, this will militate against a retroactive award.
Would a retroactive award cause hardship to payor?
This is a distinct element from the
s. 10
undue hardship test.
Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.

Turning to how far back retroactive payments should go, it turns on the conduct of the parents.  If there was no blameworthy behaviour, the retroactivity should go to when the custodial parent informs the payor that they are seeking additional support.  Generally there will be a limit of 3 years.  For blameworthy parents, the retroactivity should continue to when the support should have changed and did not, without limit.
As to the amount of a retroactive payment, the court should follow the
Guidelines
, but the court has broad discretion to craft a remedy that would be fair having regard to all the circumstances, including hardship on the payor.
Applying this to the cases...
This was an initial application for child support.  The parents had a shared custody arrangement that thought that meant no child support was payable (see
Contino v Leonelli-Contino
).  The incomes of the parents were relatively equal and due to the shared custody any money going to one household would simply be removed from the other.  Due to the lack of blameworthy conduct and the lack of benefit to the children, no retroactive support was awarded.
The father from whom support was being sought was low income (~$23,000/year) and he was supporting a second family.  Any retroactive award would cause his household hardship.  The access costs for him were also high.  Because of the lack of blameworthy conduct, the hardship a retroactive award would cause, and the fact that the standard of living in the custodial household was higher, no retroactive support was awarded.
In this case, the mother had broached the subject with the father but could not afford a lawyer to fight the case.  She was intimidated by her ex-husband and did not know much about his financial situation as he lived in another city.  The husband had had a huge income increase and held it from her, as well as saying that she should have managed her money better to better provide for their kids and that he was paying all he could afford.  Due to the large amount of blameworthy conduct and the large discrepancy in the amount he was paying and the table amount, the court awarded $100,000 in retroactive support.
As in
Henry
, the parties had very different incomes; the father earned more than $100,000K/year, much more than the mother, and he gave no financial support when the need arose.  The mother said she had not wanted to litigate because of the effect it had had on her daughter the last time they litigated.  The court held that the delay of mother was not unreasonable, and the father had no reasonable grounds on which to believe the level of support he was paying was reasonable, and thus the award granted at trial was upheld.
Abella, dissenting in part, had three issues with the decision of Bastarache.
The presumptive starting date of effective notice: the payor has the information on when their income changes, so it is impractical and unrealistic to expect the recipient to keep tabs on the payor’s income; the date should be when the income changes.
The role of blameworthy conduct: the conduct of the payor should be immaterial; the whole obligation depends on the income increase, conduct of the parties is irrelevant.
The three year cutoff: Abella finds this arbitrary - any cutoff of this type should be found in statute, not created by the courts.","Retroactive child support orders should no longer be rare or difficult to obtain.
Established the framework for assessing claims where there is a large, undisclosed swing in income.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?
Children are entitled to support from both parents commensurate with their ability to pay.

This case is sometimes referred to as the ""don't-ask-don't-tell"" case, as the

The question was whether the provincial charge was valid and if the doctrine of res judicata applied due to the prior acquittal.","Is the provincial offence of driving without due care and attention ultra vires the provincial legislature as trespassing on the federal criminal law power, or does the prior acquittal for dangerous driving under the Criminal Code constitute res judicata?",The Supreme Court of Canada upheld the validity of the provincial charge and found that res judicata did not apply. The appeal was dismissed.,"The Court held that the provincial legislation's pith and substance was the regulation of highway traffic, falling under provincial jurisdiction over property and civil rights and local matters, and did not invade the federal criminal law field. While overlapping facts may exist, the 'matter' or 'aspect' dealt with by the provincial law (regulatory standard of care) is distinct from that dealt with by the federal law (criminal public danger). The doctrine of res judicata applies only where the same 'offence' is charged or where the essential 'matter' has been necessarily determined; the provincial offence of careless driving and the federal offence of dangerous driving are not the same offence and require different elements to be proven.","Provincial legislation creating an offence of driving without due care and attention is a valid exercise of provincial power over highway regulation and does not infringe on the federal criminal law power. The doctrine of res judicata does not apply to prevent a provincial charge for careless driving following an acquittal for dangerous driving under the Criminal Code arising from the same incident, as the offences regulate different aspects of conduct and are not the same matter.","O'Grady was charged under s. 55(1) of the Manitoba
Highway Traffic Act
(now
s. 188
) which prohibited driving ""on a highway without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway"".

s. 219
) of the
Criminal Code

ultra vires

He reaffirmed the principle that there exists a ""general area"" or ""domain"" of criminal law and the two governments can make law on the same matter by creating a distinction between the types of culpability.  He quotes from Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law:
There are only two states of mind which constitute
mens rea
, and they are intention and recklessness. The difference between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; they are opposed and it is a logical fallacy to suggest that recklessness is a degree of negligence. The common habit of lawyers to qualify the word ""negligence"" with some moral epithet such as ""wicked"", ""gross"", or ""culpable"" has been most unfortunate since it has inevitably led to great confusion of thought and of principle. It is equally misleading to speak of criminal negligence since this is merely to use an expression to explain itself.
On the facts, Judson found that there was overlap between the laws however ""there is no conflict between these provisions in the sense that they are repugnant"". The provincial law extended to include ""inadvertent negligence"" as well as regular negligence. It was enough that “the two pieces of legislation differed both in legislative purpose and legal and practical effect” to justify both of them.","The distinction between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; recklessness is when an actor does not desire harmful consequences but forsees the possibility and consciously takes the risk.
There must be an operational incompatibility between federal and provincial law to invoke paramountcy."

The claimant applied for a pension under the Pension Act, which defined 'spouse' for common-law partners as someone cohabiting in a conjugal relationship 'if the veteran was not married'.",Did the veteran's ongoing legal marriage to another person at the time of his death prevent his common-law partner from being considered a 'spouse' under the Pension Act due to the statutory requirement that the veteran 'was not married'?,"No. The Supreme Court of Canada held that the veteran was 'married' at the time of his death because he was still legally married, thus the common-law partner did not qualify as a 'spouse' under the Act's definition.","The Court interpreted the word 'married' in the Pension Act according to its plain and ordinary legal meaning. A person remains legally married until the marriage is terminated by death, divorce, or annulment; separation does not end a marriage. Since the veteran was still legally married when he died, he was considered 'married' for the purposes of the Act, and the condition precedent for the common-law partner to be considered a spouse (that the veteran 'was not married') was not met.","The legal definition of 'married' refers to the existence of a valid marriage contract. For the purpose of a statute defining a common-law partner as a spouse only if the veteran 'was not married', a person is considered 'married' if they are legally married to someone, even if separated and cohabiting with a common-law partner.","Mossop is a gay man, and his partner's father died.

He makes a claim to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, but refuses to argue sexual orientation as a ground, and instead will only argue family status, stating that all matters to do with homosexuals are not about sexual orientation by definition.  The case was dismissed in the lower courts.","Can a homosexual man claim discrimination against ""family status"" with his partner under

In the dissent,
L'Heureux-Dubé
says that ""family status"" should have a very broad interpretation.  She looks to the broader social context of limiting it as the majority does, and further that by looking at the plain meaning given in the statute you are really just taking the majority's opinion of the definition, which is exactly what you try to avoid in human rights issues.  She also suggests that when there are overlapping grounds, you should select the one that will succeed and proceed with that one.","Only identified grounds can be pursued in a human rights claim.

The Superintendent of Motor Vehicles revoked his driver's license based on a blanket policy prohibiting licenses for individuals with this condition, without assessing individual driving ability. Mr. Grismer challenged this policy as discrimination based on disability under the B.C. Human Rights Act, arguing he could drive safely and had passed specialized tests.","Did the Superintendent's blanket policy constitute discrimination based on disability? If so, could the discrimination be justified as a bona fide standard under the Meiorin test?","Yes, the policy constituted discrimination. No, it could not be justified. The appeal was dismissed.","Applying the Meiorin test (adapted), the Court found the policy's objective (traffic safety) was legitimate. However, the policy failed the third prong of the test (reasonable necessity/accommodation). The blanket exclusion did not accommodate individual differences; evidence showed individuals with this condition could drive safely with individualized assessment (like specialized tests). The Superintendent failed to prove that individualized assessment would cause undue hardship. Safety required assessing individual capacity, not imposing a blanket prohibition based on disability alone.","A facially neutral standard or policy that has a discriminatory effect is not justifiable if it fails to accommodate individual differences up to the point of undue hardship. Blanket exclusions based on disability are discriminatory and not justified if the legitimate purpose (e.g., safety) can be achieved through less discriminatory means, such as individualized assessment, without undue hardship.","The Government of British Columbia had a policy stating that it would not issue licenses to people suffering from a condition (homonymous hemianopsia (HH)) which affected eyesight.  The claimant had this condition but had driven flawlessly at work and on public roads using ""prism glasses"".  Despite this he was refused individual assessment and was not allowed to receive a license and was therefore unable to complete his job.  The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal allowed Grismer to be individually tested.  Grismer died shortly after this decision.  This was upheld by the British Columbia Supreme Court but overruled by the Court of Appeal.",Does an absolute prohibition on licensing people with a visual impairment without the possibility of individual assessment constitute discrimination?,"Appeal allowed, standard disallowed.","The court applies the
Meiorin
test, showing that it can be used in scenarios outside of the workplace to determine if discrimination is justified.  This case passes the first part because the purpose of the standard (reasonable safety) is rationally connected to the function (issuing drivers’ licenses).  It also passes the second step because there is no evidence that the standard (no licenses for HH sufferers) was adopted for any reasons other than road safety.  However the case fails the third step as the court finds that the standard (no licenses for HH) is not reasonably necessary for the purpose (reasonable safety).  The blanket prohibition doesn't let people even attempt to show that they can drive safely.
It is clear here that the accommodation would be to allow testing.  In order to succeed the government would have had to prove that to allow testing would result to undue hardship which they failed to do.  Although there are clearly safety and cost concerns involved with testing, the government didn't put in any effort to determine these values, nor did they even look for alternative ways of testing.  The court also says that in general, with the government, costs must be exorbitant to amount to undue hardship, as they are publicly funded and this would be seen as being in the public interest.  As the standard is not rationally necessary for the purpose of reasonable road safety, it amounts to discrimination and must be removed.","The
Meiorin
test applies to all standards that are thought to be discriminatory, even if they do not occur in a workplace; called bona fide justification tests.
The government will be held to a very high threshold when claiming that the costs of not adopting a standard amount to undue hardship as they are publicly funded and preventing discrimination is in the public interest."
GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,Just v British Columbia,The appellant was injured when a landslide from a provincial highway embankment came down onto the road he was driving on. He sued the Province of British Columbia for negligence in maintaining the embankment. The Province argued it was immune from liability for non-feasance (failure to act) in highway maintenance.,"Is the provincial Crown immune from liability for negligence in the maintenance of highways under its control, particularly regarding alleged non-feasance?","The Supreme Court of Canada held that the Province is not immune from liability for negligence in highway maintenance, regardless of whether the negligence is characterized as non-feasance or misfeasance. The case was remitted for trial.","The Court found that the historical distinction between misfeasance and non-feasance regarding municipal immunity for highway maintenance, as established in cases like *Welsh v. Municipal District of Haulkey*, did not apply to the provincial Crown. The immunity previously enjoyed by the Crown was abolished by the *Proceedings Against the Crown Act*, which makes the Crown liable in tort as if it were a private person. Having assumed responsibility for building and maintaining highways, the Crown owes a duty of care to users and adjacent property owners in carrying out this function, which includes maintenance. This duty is subject to ordinary principles of negligence.","The provincial Crown is not immune from liability for negligence in the maintenance of highways under its control, whether such negligence constitutes misfeasance or non-feasance. The abolition of Crown immunity under the *Proceedings Against the Crown Act* renders the Crown liable in tort according to ordinary principles of negligence for its positive undertakings, such as highway maintenance.","Heavy snow fall forced Just and his daughter to stop in a line of traffic by a rocky slope on a major highway.  A boulder, which worked loose from the wooded slopes above the highway, came crashing down on the appellant's car, killing the appellant's daughter and causing him very serious injuries.  Just brought an action against the provincial government contending that the government negligently failed to properly maintain the highway.
The Department of Highways had set up a system for inspection and remedial work upon rock slopes.  Inspection and recommendations were made by engineers and the work was effected by a rock scaling crew responsible for performing remedial work throughout the entire province.  The department's practice had been to make visual inspections from the highway unless rock falls or a history of instability in an area indicated a need for the rock engineer to climb the slope.  Numerous informal inspections were carried out by highway personnel as they drove along the road.
The trial judge found that the entire system of inspection and the way it was implemented was a policy matter which did not give rise to liability. No finding was made as to whether or not the system of inspection was reasonable or whether the inspections themselves were properly carried out. The Court of Appeal upheld the finding of the trial judge and Just appealled to the Supreme Court.","Is the government under a duty of care to maintain the highways and if so, are they liable if the highways are not sufficiently maintained?","Appeal allowed, new trial ordered.","Cory, writing for the majority, held that the province owes a duty of care, which ordinarily extends to their reasonable maintenance, to those using its highways.  The Department of Highways could readily foresee the risk that harm might befall users of a highway if it were not reasonably maintained.  That maintenance could be found to extend to the prevention of injury from falling rock.
Government agencies may be exempt from the application of the traditional tort law duty of care if an explicit statutory exemption exists or if the decision arose as a result of a policy decision.  Whether or not a decision is characterized as a policy decision or as an operational decision rests on the nature of the decision and not on the identity of the actors.  Generally, decisions concerning budgetary allotments for departments or government agencies should be classified as policy decisions.  A policy decision may be open to challenge on the basis that it is not made in the bona fide exercise of discretion.  If after due consideration it is found that a duty of care is owed by the government agency and no exemption by way of statute or policy decision-making is found to exist, a traditional torts analysis ensues (as per
Anns v Merton London Borough Council
) and the issue of standard of care required of the government agency must next be considered.  The manner and quality of an inspection system, since it was clearly part of the operational aspect of a governmental activity, should be assessed when consideration is given to the standard of care issue.  At this stage, the requisite standard of care must be assessed in light of all the surrounding circumstances including budgetary restraints and the availability of qualified personnel and equipment.
Sopinka, in the dissent, held that the government had the power to carry out the inspections but was under no duty to do so.  Conduct within the limits of this discretion gives rise to no duty of care; conduct outside of these limits may attract a private law duty of care.
A litigant may not attack a policy and it is not appropriate for a Court to pass on it, absent evidence that a policy was adopted for some ulterior motive and not for a municipal purpose.  In order for a private duty to arise, it would have to be shown that the Rockwork Section acted outside its delegated discretion to determine whether to inspect and the manner in which the inspection is to be made.  Policy decisions are immune from review because they usually entail not only a decision to do something but also some call upon the public purse.  The government was acting within its discretion when it decided that inspections should be done and the manner in which they were to be done.  Responsibility for deciding the extent to which the inspection program was to be implemented was delegated to the Rockwork Section.","The duty of care should apply to a public authority unless there is a valid basis for its exclusion.
Policy decisions – the decision by the government about what acts to perform under a given statute – are exempt from liability; operational decisions – the decision by the government about how to perform those acts once they have been decided - are not exempt from liability."
GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,Machtinger v HOJ Industries Ltd.,"Two employees (Machtinger and Lefebvre) were dismissed without cause after approximately 23 months and 3.5 years of service respectively. Their written employment contracts specified notice periods upon termination without cause (4 weeks for Machtinger, 2 weeks per year of service to a maximum of 26 weeks for Lefebvre) which were less than the common law standard of reasonable notice and arguably did not comply with the minimum notice periods required by the Ontario Employment Standards Act (ESA) at the time. The employer provided only the notice specified in the contracts. The employees sued for wrongful dismissal, claiming they were entitled to common law reasonable notice because the contractual notice provisions were void for non-compliance with the ESA.","If an employment contract provides for a notice period upon termination without cause that is less than the minimum period required by provincial employment standards legislation, is the contractual notice provision void, thereby entitling the employee to the common law standard of reasonable notice?","Yes. The Supreme Court of Canada held that the contractual notice provisions were void for failing to comply with the minimum requirements of the Employment Standards Act. As a result, the employees were entitled to common law reasonable notice.","The Court reasoned that the Employment Standards Act sets minimum standards for termination that cannot be contracted out of to the detriment of the employee. Any contractual provision that attempts to provide less than the statutory minimum notice is void for illegality. When the contractual provision regarding notice is void, there is no longer an express term governing notice, and the implied term of common law reasonable notice applies by default. The employer cannot rely on an illegal term in the contract. The fact that the employer might have provided notice that *actually* complied with the ESA minimums (but not the common law standard) is irrelevant; the validity of the *contractual term itself* is assessed at the time the contract is made. The purpose of the ESA is remedial and protective of employees, which would be undermined by allowing reliance on non-compliant clauses.","An employment contract term that provides for a period of notice upon termination without cause that is less than the minimum required by applicable employment standards legislation is void. When a contractual termination provision is void due to contravention of minimum statutory standards, the employee is entitled to the common law standard of reasonable notice unless another valid contractual term or statutory provision specifies otherwise.","Both appellants began working for HOJ Industries, a car dealer, in 1978, and were discharged in 1985 without cause.  At the time they were dismissed Machtinger was credit manager and rust‑proofing sales manager and Lefebvre was sales manager.  Each had entered into a contract for employment for an indefinite period which contained a clause allowing the respondent to terminate his employment without cause, in Machtinger's case without notice and in Lefebvre's case on two weeks' notice.  Under the provincial
Employment Standards Act
the appellants were entitled to a minimum notice period of four weeks.  After they were dismissed, the respondent paid each of them the equivalent of four weeks' salary.  The appellants brought action for wrongful dismissal and the trial judge found that they were entitled to reasonable notice of termination, and that the period of reasonable notice for Machtinger was 7 months and for Lefebvre, 7½ months, however this was overturned by the Court of Appeal.",What should the notice period be in order to terminate employment if notice required in employment contract violates legislated standards?,"Appeal allowed, lower court judgment restored.","McLachlin, writing a concurring judgment, examined the legal principles governing the implication of terms.  She identifies three types of implied terms:
terms implied by fact (intention required);
terms implied by law (no intention required); and
terms implied by custom and usage,
and identifies #2 as the type the courts will read into a contract.  Implication of law can be from custom, for business efficiency (what is necessary in a contract), or what is reasonable (from Denning's dissent in
Liverpool City Council v Irwin
).
She finds that the Court of Appeal erred in characterizing a term implied in law as a term implied in fact, which brought in the intentionality of the parties.  Holding that the employer had a legal obligation to provide reasonable notice and that this can only be displaced by an express contrary agreement, the court imposed a reasonable term of notification on HOJ; HOJ industries.","Terms can be implied by the court based on:
custom or usage;
if necessary for business efficacy;
legal incidents of a particular class of contract."
GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,Homex Realty and Development Co. Ltd. v Wyoming (Village),"Homex Realty owned land in the Village of Wyoming and sought to subdivide it. Development required municipal approval, including plan approval and building permits. Disputes arose between Homex and the Village council regarding the provision of services (water, sewer) and financial obligations. The Village council passed a by-law and resolutions effectively blocking Homex's development plans or demanding significant payments and services from Homex as a condition of approval, which Homex contended were not legally required or authorized. Homex challenged these municipal actions.","Did the Village of Wyoming act within its statutory authority when passing by-laws and resolutions that effectively blocked Homex's development or imposed conditions for approval, or were these actions ultra vires (beyond its powers)? Was the Village's decision-making process tainted by improper motive or bias?","The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal, restoring the trial judge's judgment. The Court quashed the impugned by-law and resolutions and ordered the Village to approve Homex's plans, effectively finding the Village's actions invalid.","The Court found that the Village's actions were ultra vires. The municipality was using its planning and permit powers for an improper purpose, attempting to extract payments and services from the developer beyond what was permitted by the relevant provincial legislation (Planning Act, Municipal Act). The Village's demands and conditions were not authorized by statute. While potential bias or improper motive was discussed, the primary ground for invalidating the municipal actions was that they were beyond the scope of the Village's statutory powers.","A municipality cannot use its statutory powers (such as approving plans or issuing permits) for an unauthorized or improper purpose, such as extracting payments or imposing conditions not permitted by the relevant legislation. Municipal actions taken for an improper purpose are ultra vires and invalid.","As a condition of registration of a plan of subdivision in the Village of Wyoming, Atkinson, the owner and subdivider of the parcel of land, entered into an agreement with the Village for the installation of municipal services in the subdivision. This agreement, dated January 22, 1968, and registered September 26, 1975, provided in a general way for the owner's providing ""all the requirements financial and otherwise, of the Corporation re surfacing of roads, installation of services and drainage"". The agreement also prevented the sale of the lands in question until the agreement had been fully carried out, except with the consent of the Village, but the provision did not provide that consent would operate to release Atkinson from his obligation to the Village. Before any services were installed, Homex bought the great majority of the lots on the subdivision with the Village's consent. There was some question as to whether or not Homex had undertaken to assume the obligations of the original subdivider. Nevertheless, when protracted negotiations between the Village and Homex concerning the installation of services proved fruitless, the Village, in April 1976, pursuant to s. 29(3) (now
s. 50(3)
) of the
Planning Act
and without notice to Homex, enacted by-law 7 deeming the lots purchased by Homex not to be a registered plan of subdivision. Homex, in September 1976, made application for judicial review for an order quashing by-law 7 and, while the application was pending, checkerboarded its lots.
In November 1975, Homex and the Village negotiated the installation of services along the only street requiring them. By-law 6, enacted in December 1975, provided that it was the policy of the Village that it would neither assume responsibility for a water pipeline constructed by Homex nor permit its connection to the municipal water supply system. Homex coupled an application in judicial review to quash by-law 6 with the application for an order to quash by-law 7.","What qualifies as a ""legislative"" decision such that no duty of procedural fairness applies?",Appeal dismissed.,"Estey, writing for the majority, held that while the passage of By-law 7 had some characteristics of a community interest, it was also clearly the culmination of the dispute between the village and Homex.  As a result he found that the decision was quasi-judicial such as to attract the principle of notice and the doctrine of
audi alteram partem
.  Despite this, however, he held that the conduct of Homex to rid itself of the obligations under the agreement with Atkinson were such that it should be denied a discretionary remedy.  There was also no basis to challenge By-law 6 as it simply stated the facts of the agreement with Atkinson.
Dickson, in the dissent, is quoted:
The courts long ago developed the general proposition that wherever a statute authorizes the interference with property or other rights and is silent as to whether or not the agency in question is required to give notice prior to the intervention in such rights, the courts will ""supply the omission of the legislature"" and require the agency in question to afford the subject an opportunity of being heard before it proceeds.
He held that an act could not be labelled ""legislative"" merely for the purpose of dispensing with fairness. It was not particularly important that the function of the municipality was classified as ""legislative"" or ""quasi-judicial"", rather, it was necessary to look at the nature of the function and to the facts of each case. The by-law in question was not of wide and general application, but was rather aimed at deliberately limiting the rights of Homex, entitling it to some procedural safeguards - at a minimum, notice of the proposed by-law and the opportunity to be heard.","In general, the courts have not imposed procedural requirements on the subordinate law-making function.
The facts of each case are key to determining the level of procedural fairness required."
GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,Bell Canada v Canadian Telephone Employees Association,"Bell Canada disputed an arbitration award concerning the interpretation of a collective agreement and benefits plan regarding long-term disability (LTD) benefits for employees. The arbitration board held that employees on LTD leave were entitled to continue receiving medical and dental benefits even after reaching age 65, despite a provision in the LTD plan stating that disability income payments would cease at that age. Bell Canada argued the board misinterpreted the plan and collective agreement and exceeded its jurisdiction.","Did the arbitration board err in interpreting the collective agreement and benefits plan, or exceed its jurisdiction, by ruling that employees on long-term disability leave were entitled to continued medical and dental benefits after reaching age 65?","The Supreme Court of Canada upheld the arbitration board's award, dismissing Bell Canada's appeal.","The Court applied a standard of review appropriate for a labour arbitration decision. They found that the arbitration board's interpretation of the collective agreement and the associated benefits plan was reasonable and did not amount to an excess of jurisdiction. The board's interpretation that the clause terminating disability income at age 65 did not necessarily terminate all other benefits (like medical/dental), which could continue based on the employee's status as being on leave or other provisions, was considered a plausible reading of the complex contractual documents.","Labour arbitrators are owed deference when interpreting collective agreements and related benefit plans. An arbitration board's interpretation of a collective agreement and benefit plan, finding that employees on long-term disability leave are entitled to continue receiving certain non-income benefits (such as medical and dental coverage) after reaching an age specified for the cessation of disability income benefits, is generally a reasonable interpretation within their jurisdiction and will be upheld on judicial review unless found to be unreasonable or patently unreasonable.","This is an appeal of the decision in
Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada v Bell Canada

On appeal Bell is arguing that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal process is unfair because the Canadian Human Rights Commission makes regulations that the Tribunal must follow, and then appears in front of them seeking favorable decisions.  They claim that this constitutes a conflict of interest and a lack of necessary ""judicial"" independence.",Does the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal lack independence and impartiality because of the power of the Canadian Human Rights Commission to issue binding guidelines for them before they appear in front of them?,"Appeal dismissed, case to proceed to Tribunal.","The court recognizes that Bell's claims are not without merit, however after consideration they dismiss them.  The court held that Bell did not provide sufficient evidence for their claims and also because they misunderstand impartiality - it does not mean having the freedom to decide a case however one wishes to, being subject to certain binding principles is perfectly legitimate for an impartial judiciary.  Further, the Commission cannot create guidelines that favour them in the Tribunal, because to do so would be
ultra vires

Canadian Human Rights Act
and the Tribunal is not bound by any such guidelines.  The powers that the Commission has to enact guidelines under
s.27(2)

are constrained as all powers to create subordinate legislation are, and therefore the system is not flawed.","Having one's decisions bound by enacted guidelines does not affect impartiality.

GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,Catholic Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto v CM,"C.M., a mother, sought access to her children after they were made Crown wards under the Child and Family Services Act (CFSA) and placed for adoption. The Catholic Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto opposed the access, arguing that Crown wardship extinguishes parental rights, including access, and that granting access would not be in the children's best interests, particularly as adoption was planned.","Does a parent whose children have been made Crown wards and placed for adoption retain a 'right' to access their children under section 21(1) of the Child and Family Services Act, and if not, on what basis should access applications be considered?","The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal in part, clarifying that former parents do not retain a right to access after a Crown wardship order. Access applications by former parents under s. 21(1) must be determined based solely on the best interests of the child, with no presumption in favour of access for the former parent.","The Court held that a Crown wardship order extinguishes all parental rights, including any inherent right to access. Section 21(1) permits 'a person entitled to access' to apply to the court; however, a former parent is not 'entitled' as a matter of right after wardship. While former parents can *apply* under s. 21(1) as 'any person', their success depends entirely on demonstrating that access is in the 'best interests of the child' as defined by the Act. The Court emphasized that the best interests test requires considering factors like stability, security, and the importance of a continuous relationship in a stable family unit (the adoptive family), and severing ties with former parents is often in the child's best interest after adoption. The burden is on the former parent to prove access is in the child's best interests.","A parent whose children have been made Crown wards under the Child and Family Services Act (Ontario) loses all parental rights, including the right to access. Any application for access by a former parent under section 21(1) is not based on a residual right but is treated as an application by any person, the success of which depends solely and entirely on whether granting access is in the best interests of the child, with no presumption favouring continued access by the former parent.","The aid society took SM into protection on several occasions and supervised her mother, CM, on parenting skills. On consent, SM was made a ward of the society 1989. Throughout the wardship, the society continued to work with CM and facilitated regular visits with SM, however, bonding between mother and daughter remained minimal. In December 1989, after a second four-month wardship, the society brought a status review application seeking an order of Crown wardship without access for the purposes of adoption. CM opposed the motion and the matter was dealt with sporadically throughout 1991. In February 1992 the Ontario Provincial Court ordered that SM be returned to CM on the basis that court intervention was no longer necessary to protect the child. The judge considered CM capable of acquiring the skill to care for her daughter adequately. The society obtained a stay of the order and unsuccessfully appealed to the Ontario Court (General Division). The Court of Appeal granted a stay of the order for return pending appeal and a motion for the introduction of fresh evidence. The new evidence concerned the consistent and repeated assertions of the child that she regarded her foster family as her real family, that she did not want to see her birth mother and that attempts to implement access visits with CM had become almost impossible because of the child's negative reactions - emotional, psychological and physical.  It allowed the appeal, set aside the order for the return of the child to the mother and ordered that the child be made a Crown ward without access for the purposes of adoption. CM appealed to the Supreme Court.",Does the child need continued protection?,Appeal dismissed.,"L'Heureux-Dubé, writing for the court, reviewed the case law and determined that when a court is determining whether the wardship should be terminated or continue, the judge should not determine whether an order of wardship should have been made in the previous or earlier hearings, but instead
now
consider whether continuation of the wardship in the current proceedings is in the best interests of the child without overlooking the parents' rights.  The review hearing is not about retrying the original need for a protection order, but rather the court should determine the circumstances of the parents or parent since the last order as it relates to the situation with respect to the child's custody, including their physical, mental and emotional state since that time and also whether there is now a lifestyle, including attitudes of the parent, that warrants the child being returned to the parent or to wardship.
She lays out a two part test:
Does the child continue to need protection and require a court order for protection?
The children's aid society must continue to justify its intervention by showing that a court order is necessary to protect the child in the future.  This does not mean that an absence of proof of a deficiency in the parent's parenting capacity is enough to return the child to the parent.  A court order may be necessary to protect the child from emotional harm which would result in future if the child were taken from its psychological parents.
What is in the best interests of the children?
This should be decided through a balancing of the considerations such as the importance of the continuity of care, the child’s physical/emotional/psychological needs, the benefit of a child's bond to his/her biological parent, as well as psychological bonding of child to his/her foster family.
The furtherance and protection of the child’s best interests must take priority over the desires and interests of the parent.
The question is not merely whether the parent has seen the light and is now prepared to be a good parent, but whether or not the parent has, in factk turned a new leaf and whether he or she is now able to give to the children the care they require?

Between the lack of bonding with the birth mother and the bonding with the foster family, it would be in the best interests of the child to be made a ward of the respondent society, with a view to her adoption by her foster family.",Two stage test for review of a protection order.

Edgeworth relied on these plans and specifications when preparing its bid. After commencing work, Edgeworth discovered errors and deficiencies in the design documents, leading to increased costs. Edgeworth sued N.D. Lea for negligent misrepresentation. There was no direct contractual relationship between Edgeworth and N.D. Lea. The contract between the government and Edgeworth contained a disclaimer clause stating the contractor would not rely solely on the plans and specifications.","Could the consulting engineers (N.D. Lea) be held liable in negligence (specifically negligent misrepresentation) to the contractor (Edgeworth) for errors in the design and specifications, despite the absence of a direct contractual relationship? Did the disclaimer clause in the contract between the owner and the contractor negate any duty of care owed by the engineers to the contractor?","Yes, the consulting engineers owed a duty of care to the contractor and could be held liable for negligent misrepresentation. The disclaimer clause in the contract between the owner and the contractor did not protect the engineers from liability to the contractor.","The Court found that the engineers knew their plans and specifications would be relied upon by contractors bidding on the project. This knowledge established sufficient proximity between the engineers and the contractors to give rise to a prima facie duty of care. The engineers undertook responsibility for preparing accurate documents upon which bidders would rely. The disclaimer clause was contained in the contract between the owner and the contractor; the engineers were not a party to this contract, and the clause did not explicitly extend protection to them. Therefore, the disclaimer did not negate the duty of care owed by the engineers to the contractor. The engineers made representations (the accuracy of the plans) that they knew would be relied upon by a specific group (bidders), and this reliance was reasonable.","Consulting engineers who prepare plans and specifications for public tender projects owe a duty of care in negligent misrepresentation to contractors who they know will rely on those documents when preparing their bids, notwithstanding the absence of a direct contractual relationship between the engineers and the contractors. A disclaimer clause in the contract between the project owner and the contractor does not automatically protect the engineers from liability to the contractor unless the clause explicitly extends protection to the engineers or they are a party to that contract.","Edgeworth Construction Ltd. was engaged in the business of building roads in British Columbia.

How should courts balance the principle of respecting private agreements with the objectives of spousal support under the Divorce Act?,"The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal in part, articulating a two-stage test for reviewing spousal support provisions in separation agreements and remitting the case for reconsideration based on this test.","The Court recognized the importance of upholding separation agreements as reflecting parties' autonomy and desire for finality. However, such agreements are not absolute and must be reviewed in light of the Divorce Act's objectives for spousal support. The Court developed a two-stage test: Stage 1 examines the circumstances surrounding the negotiation and execution of the agreement (e.g., pressure, duress, lack of disclosure, understanding). Stage 2, if the agreement is validly formed, considers whether the substance of the agreement, at the time of the application, continues to comply with the objectives of the Divorce Act, giving significant weight to the agreement unless unforeseen changes have led to consequences not contemplated by the parties that frustrate the Act's objectives.","Courts reviewing spousal support provisions in separation agreements must apply a two-stage test. First, assess the circumstances of the agreement's negotiation and execution for fairness, autonomy, and information disclosure. Second, if the agreement passes the first stage, assess whether, at the time of the application, the agreement substantially complies with the objectives of the Divorce Act in light of current circumstances, giving significant weight to the parties' intentions unless unforeseen circumstances necessitate variation to achieve the Act's objectives.","The parties were married for 14 years and had four children. They operated a resort lodge in Algonquin Park in the summer and lived in Toronto in the winter. Both parties worked in the business; the husband handled the finance and the wife the day-to-day operation of the lodge. When they separated in 1993, both parties were in their early 40s and all the children were under 8 years old. The wife wanted to stay home with the children given their ages. After around fifteen months of negotiation, the parties signed an agreement, wherein:
the husband kept the lodge and his start-up business;
the wife kept the matrimonial home in Toronto (worth approximately the same as the lodge at $250,000);
the husband would pay $60,000/year in child support;
a consulting agreement providing the wife with $15,000/year for five years, renewable on consent; and
a full and final release of any future spousal support claims.
After the divorce judgment was issued in 1997, the wife's childcare obligations changed and the consulting agreement was not renewed. She applied to the court for relief, including spousal support.

The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment regarding spousal support, and the husband was given leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.",When should a support agreement be upheld by the courts?,Appeal allowed; original support order stands.,"Arbour and Bastarache, writing for the majority, stress finality and certainty as key principles in support agreements, citing
s. 9 of the
Divorce Act
; these are contracts and as long as they were entered into openly, the courts should enforce them.
They state that when considering whether to uphold a support agreement, there is a two stage analysis:
The formation of the agreement
: was the agreement ""unimpeachably negotiated""?
Factors to consider:
representation by counsel: the degree of professional assistance received by the party is relevant, but a court should not presume an imbalance of power.
circumstances: was one or both parties vulnerable and if so, did presence of counsel rectify this vulnerability?
duration of negotiations: was the agreement negotiated over a reasonable amount of time?
Substance of the agreement: does the agreement remain in substantial compliance with the objectives of the
Divorce Act
?
The analysis should not be restricted to the spousal support component – look at the whole agreement; the agreement as a whole should substantially comply with the factors and objectives of the
Act
(including the principles of certainty, autonomy and finality).
An agreement can be modified to bring it in line with the principles in the
Act
.
Agreement's correspondence to the parties' original intentions
: were the current circumstances anticipated when the agreement was drafted?
Foreseeability is interpreted broadly; circumstances do not have to have been explicitly considered/contemplated
Foreseeable circumstances include a change of job, assets going down in value, etc.

Generally, where negotiation of the agreement was correct and the agreement remains in substantial compliance with the
Act
, the court should defer to the wishes of the party and accord the agreement great weight.
Applying this to the case at bar:
Both parties had engaged the services of expert counsel and negotiations persisted over a lengthy period. Although the husband may have been the dominant party, the wife had adequate counsel; there was no hint of any vulnerabilities that might not be compensated by counsel.
The quantum of child support established in the agreement intended to provide the wife with a minimum amount of income in contemplation of her not working. While the wife argues that the business generates income, this was accounted for when the assets were valued and divided. The consulting contract reflects the parties' intention to provide the wife with a source of employment income for a limited time. The wife chose not to go back to the workforce, and had substantial assets even without support; there was no hardship or long-term disadvantage.
In the result, the original order should stand.
LeBel and Deschamps, in the dissent, stress very different concepts: interdependence and unequal bargaining power.  They propose a simpler test; is the agreement objectively unfair when considered now?
The dissenters disagree with the majority in two key areas.  One, the presence of counsel may not be enough to negate a power imbalance, and two, that very little deference should be given to agreements that deviate from the objectives in
s. 15.2(6)
of the
Act
; any fair agreement should reasonably realize the four stated objectives.","Establishes the test for enforcement of support agreements.

GEMINI.gemini-2.5-flash-preview,Dobson v Dobson,"The defendant, a pregnant woman, was involved in a motor vehicle accident caused by her own negligent driving. Her child, born later, suffered severe injuries alleged to be a result of the accident while in utero. The child, through his litigation guardian (his father), sued the mother for negligence.",Does a mother owe a legal duty of care to her fetus (her future child) which can give rise to a cause of action in negligence for prenatal injuries caused by the mother's negligent conduct?,No. The Supreme Court of Canada held that a mother does not owe a legal duty of care to her fetus in the operation of a motor vehicle.,"Recognizing such a duty would involve an unacceptable intrusion into the fundamental rights of the pregnant woman, including her bodily integrity, autonomy, and privacy. It would require scrutinizing her lifestyle choices and actions during pregnancy based on potential harm to the fetus. The relationship between a pregnant woman and her fetus is unique and not amenable to the conventional application of tort principles regarding duty of care. Policy considerations, particularly the potential impact on women's rights and the difficulty of setting a standard of care for maternal conduct, militated against recognizing this duty at common law.",A pregnant woman does not owe a legal duty of care to her fetus that would support a cause of action in negligence for prenatal injuries caused by her conduct. The unique nature of the mother-fetus relationship and the mother's fundamental rights to autonomy and privacy preclude the imposition of such a duty at common law.,"Cynthia Dobson was a pregnant woman.  While in the 27th week of pregnancy she was driving her car when her negligent actions caused a car accident.  The fetus was permanently injured, and was born prematurely that day.  Her son, Ryan Dobson, suffered physical and mental injuries, including cerebral palsy.  His grandfather launched a tort claim for damages against his mother.  Ryan was successful at the Court of Appeal, which his mother appealed.",Should a mother be liable in tort for damages to her child arising from a prenatal negligent act that allegedly injured the fetus in her womb?,Appeal allowed.,"Cory, writing for the majority, finds that the mother should not be held liable in the situation because of the policy implications.  They employ the
Kamloops
test to determine if a duty of care should be owed.  It has two parts:
Is the relationship between the two parties close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there any public policy implications that should negate or limit the scope of the duty?
They find that the first part is satisfied; however the public policy implications negate the duty.  They state that there are two main reasons for this: it would violate the privacy and autonomy of women, and it is impossible to judicially define a reasonable standard of conduct for pregnant women.
McLachlin, in a concurring judgment, states that another main reason why this duty cannot be imposed is that it would violate pregnant women's rights under the
Charter
– specifically liberty and equality.  They would lose their liberty, and not be treated equally with other women in society.
Major, in the dissent, states that in order for the public policy implications to negate the duty they must add new restrictions on what the woman can do.  He says that this is not the case, because she had a duty of care to everyone else on the road, and extending that to the foetus would not change the reasonable standard of her conduct.  He says that this case deals specifically with pregnant women driving automobiles, and if the creation of duty imposed a limitation on her actions that was not there previously then the outcome would be different.  He uses the example with another pregnant woman in the car – if the same outcome occurred, then there is no question that the other woman's foetus could sue her for negligence.  He agrees that the
Kamloops
test applies, but says that the policy implications here do not negate the duty.","Pregnant women do not owe a duty of care to the foetus in their womb.
The test to determine if a duty of care is owed has two parts:
