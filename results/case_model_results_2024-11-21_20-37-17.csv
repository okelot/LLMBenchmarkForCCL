They claimed that their nation had never ceded or surrendered their ancestral lands to the Crown and sought a declaration that their Aboriginal title to these lands still existed."",   ""ratio"": ""The court held that Aboriginal title is a legal right that arises from the prior occupation of land by Indigenous peoples and is protected by section 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. The court also established that the Crown has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of Indigenous peoples when dealing with their lands."",   ""decision"": ""The Supreme Court of Canada ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, declaring that the Nisga'a Nation had Aboriginal title to their ancestral lands and that the Crown had a fiduciary duty to protect their interests. The court also established that Aboriginal title is a constitutional right that cannot be extinguished without the consent of the Indigenous people or by a clear and plain intention of the Crown."" }","facts: The appellants are representative of the Nishga Tribe of British Columbia.  They claim that the aboriginal title over a piece of land in British Columbia that had been present before Confederation had never been extinguished, and that the tribe therefore still had title to the land.  This claim was denied at trial and upheld at appeal.
issue: Do the alleged aboriginal land claims exist?
If the claims exist, were they extinguished?
decision: Appeal dismissed.
reasons: At trial and upon initial appeal the courts decided that if there ever was aboriginal title, it was surely extinguished upon confederation.  The Supreme Court holds that aboriginal title definitely exists, however they were split over whether or not it had been extinguished.  The majority decided that it has been extinguished by virtue of the government's exercise of control over the lands, and therefore the appeal is dismissed.  However, the dissenting judges disagree and state that more must be present to prove that the lands were extinguished.  They say that the provincial government did not have any constitutional right to deal with the land of the aboriginals, and that their predecessors before confederation did not do anything that could amount to extinguishing the lands.
ratio: Recognition of aboriginal title.
Aboriginal land claims are extinguished once government exercises control over the lands."

The court also held that the mother's actions were not justified under section 1 of the Charter, which allows for reasonable limits on Charter rights."",   ""decision"": ""The court declared the court order authorizing the sterilization to be invalid and of no force or effect. The court also awarded Mrs. E. damages for the harm she suffered as a result of the sterilization."" }","facts: Eve was a 24 year-old mentally disabled woman living in PEI with a condition that made it very difficult for her to communicate with others.  She was sent away from her mother, who cared for her, during the week so that she could attend a special school.  Her mother was seeking the court's permission to perform a sterilization procedure (hysterectomy) on her daughter.  There was considerable evidence that the daughter would be incapable of handling the burdens of motherhood.  Eve had struck up a friendship with a boy from school, and discussed marriage, and her mother is afraid of the burden that would be placed on Eve, and ultimately upon herself to look after a child if pregnancy ensued.  Permission was denied at trial, but granted at the Court of Appeal.
issue: Can a caregiver for someone incapable of giving informed consent make decisions about surgeries for the incapable individual?
decision: Appeal allowed.
reasons: La Forest, writing for a unanimous court, discusses the history of
parens patriae
jurisdiction, which states that the state is responsible for decisions concerning those that cannot give informed consent themselves. He says that the test is generally that the only procedures that will be allowed are ones that are in the ""best interests"" of the protected person. He focuses his criticism in this case on the fact that Mrs. E. is claiming that the burden on her to look after the child should be considered in making the decision. La Forest states that this should be given no consideration, as it is only the best interests of the protected person that are of concern.
He also says that arguing about the protected person's fitness as a parents involves value-loaded questions that result in a designation of disabled persons as less competent parents, even though there is significant evidence showing that they show as much fondness and concern for their children as anyone else. He also considers that the procedure of a hysterectomy is serious surgery and quite invasive, and further that Eve does not require assistance caring for her reproductive cycle, which is a concern in other cases. Perhaps most importantly, this surgery is not therapeutic.
La Forest concludes that ""the grave intrusion on a person’s rights and the certain physical damage that ensues from non-therapeutic sterilization without consent, when compared to the highly questionable advantages that can result, [show that] it can never safely be determined that such a procedure is for the benefit of the person."" The procedure should never be authorized for non-therapeutic purposes under the
parens patriae
jurisdiction.
ratio: Non-therapeutic surgeries can never be determined to be for the benefit of a person who is incapable of giving informed consent.
It is only the best interests of the disabled person concerned that are of importance; concerns of others should not be considered."

The father had sole interim custody after separation but then the parties entered into an informal shared custody arrangement where neither party paid support.  Three years later the mother brought an action in Alberta for retroactive and ongoing support.  The chambers judge awarded her prospective support but not retroactive.  The Court of Appeal allowed her appeal, but found no blameworthy conduct or willful failure to disclose on the part of the father.
Three children were born in the course of a common law relationship. After separation the children lived with the mother, and some months later the father paid $150 in child support pursuant to a maintenance agreement which was increased to $300/month following a consent order.  The mother brought an action for retroactive support.  The father had low income and high access costs and resisted the action.  The chambers judge held retroactive support would constitute hardship.
Parents married in 1984 and divorced in 1991. After separation the two children lived with their mother and a divorce judgment ordered the father to pay $700/month in child support.  In 2000 the mother signaled an intention to request increased support.  The father voluntarily increased his payments, but still below the table amount.  The mother was unaware that his income had increased dramatically as they lived in different cities.  At chambers, the judge granted her application for retroactive support based on the table amount, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal in a 2-1 judgment.
Parents divorced in 1996.  The children lived with the father, then one of the children moved to lived with the mother.  The father had a lot more income and the mother asked for an increase of support but the father rejected the request.  The mother was hesitant to take the case to court because earlier proceedings had caused a rift between the mother and children.  The chambers judge held that this was an appropriate circumstance for a retroactive award, and he calculated it from January 1, 2003 onward, to be paid in the amount of $500/month, as a ""reasonable compromise"" that best fit the situation of the parties.  The Court of Appeal upheld the decision.
All of these proceedings were merged before the Supreme Court.
issue: Who is entitled to retroactive child support?
decision: The appeals in
DBS
and
TAR
should be allowed and the decisions of the chambers judges restored.  The appeals in
Henry
and
Hiemstra
should be dismissed.
reasons: Justice Bastarache, writing for the majority, held that children are entitled to child support from both parents commensurate with their income.  To prevent liability for retroactive support, any changes in income should be reported to the custodial parent.  If this is not done and an application is brought to enforce a change, four factors should be analysed to see if retroactive support is warranted:
Undue delay: does the recipient have a reasonable excuse for not seeking support earlier?
Any voluntary, intentional choice not to apply for an increase will militate against retroactive support.  There is a balancing here; a child should not be punished for a poor choice of the parent.
Was there blameworthy conduct on the part of the payor?
This is interpreted broadly; anything that privileges the payor's interests over his/her children's right to an appropriate amount of support.
Could the payor have reasonably believed that they were discharging their support obligations?
The more significant a change in income, the more likely a court will find a payor's behaviour blameworthy if they do not proactively disclose.
Need of child/benefit: would the child benefit from retroactive award based on their needs/circumstances?
If a child's needs are being met by the current support, this will militate against a retroactive award.
Would a retroactive award cause hardship to payor?
This is a distinct element from the
s. 10
undue hardship test.
Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.

Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.
Turning to how far back retroactive payments should go, it turns on the conduct of the parents.  If there was no blameworthy behaviour, the retroactivity should go to when the custodial parent informs the payor that they are seeking additional support.  Generally there will be a limit of 3 years.  For blameworthy parents, the retroactivity should continue to when the support should have changed and did not, without limit.
As to the amount of a retroactive payment, the court should follow the
Guidelines
, but the court has broad discretion to craft a remedy that would be fair having regard to all the circumstances, including hardship on the payor.
Applying this to the cases...
This was an initial application for child support.  The parents had a shared custody arrangement that thought that meant no child support was payable (see
Contino v Leonelli-Contino
).  The incomes of the parents were relatively equal and due to the shared custody any money going to one household would simply be removed from the other.  Due to the lack of blameworthy conduct and the lack of benefit to the children, no retroactive support was awarded.
The father from whom support was being sought was low income (~$23,000/year) and he was supporting a second family.  Any retroactive award would cause his household hardship.  The access costs for him were also high.  Because of the lack of blameworthy conduct, the hardship a retroactive award would cause, and the fact that the standard of living in the custodial household was higher, no retroactive support was awarded.
In this case, the mother had broached the subject with the father but could not afford a lawyer to fight the case.  She was intimidated by her ex-husband and did not know much about his financial situation as he lived in another city.  The husband had had a huge income increase and held it from her, as well as saying that she should have managed her money better to better provide for their kids and that he was paying all he could afford.  Due to the large amount of blameworthy conduct and the large discrepancy in the amount he was paying and the table amount, the court awarded $100,000 in retroactive support.
As in
Henry
, the parties had very different incomes; the father earned more than $100,000K/year, much more than the mother, and he gave no financial support when the need arose.  The mother said she had not wanted to litigate because of the effect it had had on her daughter the last time they litigated.  The court held that the delay of mother was not unreasonable, and the father had no reasonable grounds on which to believe the level of support he was paying was reasonable, and thus the award granted at trial was upheld.
Abella, dissenting in part, had three issues with the decision of Bastarache.
The presumptive starting date of effective notice: the payor has the information on when their income changes, so it is impractical and unrealistic to expect the recipient to keep tabs on the payor’s income; the date should be when the income changes.
The role of blameworthy conduct: the conduct of the payor should be immaterial; the whole obligation depends on the income increase, conduct of the parties is irrelevant.
The three year cutoff: Abella finds this arbitrary - any cutoff of this type should be found in statute, not created by the courts.
ratio: Retroactive child support orders should no longer be rare or difficult to obtain.
Established the framework for assessing claims where there is a large, undisclosed swing in income.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?
Children are entitled to support from both parents commensurate with their ability to pay.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?
This case is sometimes referred to as the ""don't-ask-don't-tell"" case, as the
Federal Child Support Guidelines
do not require payors to update their income information each year, merely that the paying parent make disclosure at least once a year upon request of recipient parent (
s. 25
)."

Sparling argued that O'Grady was contributorily negligent because he had not worn a seatbelt at the time of the accident."",""ratio"":""The court held that the failure to wear a seatbelt does not constitute contributory negligence in the absence of evidence that the injury would have been prevented or lessened by the use of a seatbelt."",""decision"":""The court ruled in favor of O'Grady, holding that Sparling was liable for O'Grady's injuries and that O'Grady's failure to wear a seatbelt did not constitute contributory negligence.""}","facts: O'Grady was charged under s. 55(1) of the Manitoba
Highway Traffic Act
(now
s. 188
) which prohibited driving ""on a highway without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway"". The defendant challenged the law, claiming that it was beyond the power of the province because the federal government had ""occupied the field"" with a similar criminal provision in ss. 191/221 (now
s. 219
) of the
Criminal Code
, which prohibited driving with ""wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons"".  O'Grady was convicted at trial and an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba was dismissed.
issue: Are provincial laws relating to negligence with penal consequences criminal law and therefore
ultra vires
the province?
decision: Appeal dismissed.
reasons: Judson, writing for the majority, held that ""the power of a provincial legislature to enact legislation for the regulation of highway traffic is undoubted"".  He reaffirmed the principle that there exists a ""general area"" or ""domain"" of criminal law and the two governments can make law on the same matter by creating a distinction between the types of culpability.  He quotes from Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law:
There are only two states of mind which constitute
mens rea
, and they are intention and recklessness. The difference between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; they are opposed and it is a logical fallacy to suggest that recklessness is a degree of negligence. The common habit of lawyers to qualify the word ""negligence"" with some moral epithet such as ""wicked"", ""gross"", or ""culpable"" has been most unfortunate since it has inevitably led to great confusion of thought and of principle. It is equally misleading to speak of criminal negligence since this is merely to use an expression to explain itself.
On the facts, Judson found that there was overlap between the laws however ""there is no conflict between these provisions in the sense that they are repugnant"". The provincial law extended to include ""inadvertent negligence"" as well as regular negligence. It was enough that “the two pieces of legislation differed both in legislative purpose and legal and practical effect” to justify both of them.
ratio: The distinction between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; recklessness is when an actor does not desire harmful consequences but forsees the possibility and consciously takes the risk.
There must be an operational incompatibility between federal and provincial law to invoke paramountcy."

He applied to take bereavement leave from his job to go to the funeral, but is denied because his partner is neither a ""spouse"" nor a ""common law partner"" as they are both required to be of the opposite sex.  He makes a claim to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, but refuses to argue sexual orientation as a ground, and instead will only argue family status, stating that all matters to do with homosexuals are not about sexual orientation by definition.  The case was dismissed in the lower courts.
issue: Can a homosexual man claim discrimination against ""family status"" with his partner under
s.3 of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
?
decision: Appeal dismissed..
reasons: The court is upset with the appellant who refused to deal with the claim on the ground of sexual orientation, which was new at the time.  However, Mossop sticks with family status.  The majority says that you cannot interpret ""family status"" to include Mossop’s situation unless you also discuss the ground of sexual orientation, and as Mossop refuses to do so he cannot be successful.
La Forest
concurs, but instead looks to the definitions in the Act and tries to figure out what the government meant to protect under ""family status"".  He determines that this specific field was not intended to be covered.
In the dissent,
L'Heureux-Dubé
says that ""family status"" should have a very broad interpretation.  She looks to the broader social context of limiting it as the majority does, and further that by looking at the plain meaning given in the statute you are really just taking the majority's opinion of the definition, which is exactly what you try to avoid in human rights issues.  She also suggests that when there are overlapping grounds, you should select the one that will succeed and proceed with that one.
ratio: Only identified grounds can be pursued in a human rights claim.
Definitions in human rights legislation are generally interpreted broadly, but the definition given by Parliament in the statute has a good deal of authority in the court's decision on what falls under the definition and what does not."
FIREWORKS.Llama 3.1 405B,British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v British Columbia (Council of Human Rights) (Re Grismer Estate),"{   ""facts"": ""The case involved a complaint filed by the Grismer Estate against the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles, alleging discrimination based on age. The Council of Human Rights found in favor of the Grismer Estate, and the Superintendent appealed the decision."",   ""ratio"": ""The court held that the Council of Human Rights had jurisdiction to hear the complaint and that the Superintendent's decision to cancel the driver's license of the deceased was discriminatory based on age."",   ""decision"": ""The court dismissed the Superintendent's appeal and upheld the Council's decision."" }","facts: The Government of British Columbia had a policy stating that it would not issue licenses to people suffering from a condition (homonymous hemianopsia (HH)) which affected eyesight.  The claimant had this condition but had driven flawlessly at work and on public roads using ""prism glasses"".  Despite this he was refused individual assessment and was not allowed to receive a license and was therefore unable to complete his job.  The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal allowed Grismer to be individually tested.  Grismer died shortly after this decision.  This was upheld by the British Columbia Supreme Court but overruled by the Court of Appeal.
issue: Does an absolute prohibition on licensing people with a visual impairment without the possibility of individual assessment constitute discrimination?
decision: Appeal allowed, standard disallowed.
reasons: The court applies the
Meiorin
test, showing that it can be used in scenarios outside of the workplace to determine if discrimination is justified.  This case passes the first part because the purpose of the standard (reasonable safety) is rationally connected to the function (issuing drivers’ licenses).  It also passes the second step because there is no evidence that the standard (no licenses for HH sufferers) was adopted for any reasons other than road safety.  However the case fails the third step as the court finds that the standard (no licenses for HH) is not reasonably necessary for the purpose (reasonable safety).  The blanket prohibition doesn't let people even attempt to show that they can drive safely.
It is clear here that the accommodation would be to allow testing.  In order to succeed the government would have had to prove that to allow testing would result to undue hardship which they failed to do.  Although there are clearly safety and cost concerns involved with testing, the government didn't put in any effort to determine these values, nor did they even look for alternative ways of testing.  The court also says that in general, with the government, costs must be exorbitant to amount to undue hardship, as they are publicly funded and this would be seen as being in the public interest.  As the standard is not rationally necessary for the purpose of reasonable road safety, it amounts to discrimination and must be removed.
ratio: The
Meiorin
test applies to all standards that are thought to be discriminatory, even if they do not occur in a workplace; called bona fide justification tests.
The government will be held to a very high threshold when claiming that the costs of not adopting a standard amount to undue hardship as they are publicly funded and preventing discrimination is in the public interest."

In this case, the document had been drafted by the province of British Columbia."",   ""decision"": ""The court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Just, and declared that the property was rightfully theirs. The court's decision was based on the application of the contra proferentem principle, which it held was the appropriate approach in cases where the meaning of a document is ambiguous."" }","facts: Heavy snow fall forced Just and his daughter to stop in a line of traffic by a rocky slope on a major highway.  A boulder, which worked loose from the wooded slopes above the highway, came crashing down on the appellant's car, killing the appellant's daughter and causing him very serious injuries.  Just brought an action against the provincial government contending that the government negligently failed to properly maintain the highway.
The Department of Highways had set up a system for inspection and remedial work upon rock slopes.  Inspection and recommendations were made by engineers and the work was effected by a rock scaling crew responsible for performing remedial work throughout the entire province.  The department's practice had been to make visual inspections from the highway unless rock falls or a history of instability in an area indicated a need for the rock engineer to climb the slope.  Numerous informal inspections were carried out by highway personnel as they drove along the road.
The trial judge found that the entire system of inspection and the way it was implemented was a policy matter which did not give rise to liability. No finding was made as to whether or not the system of inspection was reasonable or whether the inspections themselves were properly carried out. The Court of Appeal upheld the finding of the trial judge and Just appealled to the Supreme Court.
issue: Is the government under a duty of care to maintain the highways and if so, are they liable if the highways are not sufficiently maintained?
decision: Appeal allowed, new trial ordered.
reasons: Cory, writing for the majority, held that the province owes a duty of care, which ordinarily extends to their reasonable maintenance, to those using its highways.  The Department of Highways could readily foresee the risk that harm might befall users of a highway if it were not reasonably maintained.  That maintenance could be found to extend to the prevention of injury from falling rock.
Government agencies may be exempt from the application of the traditional tort law duty of care if an explicit statutory exemption exists or if the decision arose as a result of a policy decision.  Whether or not a decision is characterized as a policy decision or as an operational decision rests on the nature of the decision and not on the identity of the actors.  Generally, decisions concerning budgetary allotments for departments or government agencies should be classified as policy decisions.  A policy decision may be open to challenge on the basis that it is not made in the bona fide exercise of discretion.  If after due consideration it is found that a duty of care is owed by the government agency and no exemption by way of statute or policy decision-making is found to exist, a traditional torts analysis ensues (as per
Anns v Merton London Borough Council
) and the issue of standard of care required of the government agency must next be considered.  The manner and quality of an inspection system, since it was clearly part of the operational aspect of a governmental activity, should be assessed when consideration is given to the standard of care issue.  At this stage, the requisite standard of care must be assessed in light of all the surrounding circumstances including budgetary restraints and the availability of qualified personnel and equipment.
Sopinka, in the dissent, held that the government had the power to carry out the inspections but was under no duty to do so.  Conduct within the limits of this discretion gives rise to no duty of care; conduct outside of these limits may attract a private law duty of care.
A litigant may not attack a policy and it is not appropriate for a Court to pass on it, absent evidence that a policy was adopted for some ulterior motive and not for a municipal purpose.  In order for a private duty to arise, it would have to be shown that the Rockwork Section acted outside its delegated discretion to determine whether to inspect and the manner in which the inspection is to be made.  Policy decisions are immune from review because they usually entail not only a decision to do something but also some call upon the public purse.  The government was acting within its discretion when it decided that inspections should be done and the manner in which they were to be done.  Responsibility for deciding the extent to which the inspection program was to be implemented was delegated to the Rockwork Section.
ratio: The duty of care should apply to a public authority unless there is a valid basis for its exclusion.
Policy decisions – the decision by the government about what acts to perform under a given statute – are exempt from liability; operational decisions – the decision by the government about how to perform those acts once they have been decided - are not exempt from liability."

At the time they were dismissed Machtinger was credit manager and rust‑proofing sales manager and Lefebvre was sales manager.  Each had entered into a contract for employment for an indefinite period which contained a clause allowing the respondent to terminate his employment without cause, in Machtinger's case without notice and in Lefebvre's case on two weeks' notice.  Under the provincial
Employment Standards Act
the appellants were entitled to a minimum notice period of four weeks.  After they were dismissed, the respondent paid each of them the equivalent of four weeks' salary.  The appellants brought action for wrongful dismissal and the trial judge found that they were entitled to reasonable notice of termination, and that the period of reasonable notice for Machtinger was 7 months and for Lefebvre, 7½ months, however this was overturned by the Court of Appeal.
issue: What should the notice period be in order to terminate employment if notice required in employment contract violates legislated standards?
decision: Appeal allowed, lower court judgment restored.
reasons: McLachlin, writing a concurring judgment, examined the legal principles governing the implication of terms.  She identifies three types of implied terms:
terms implied by fact (intention required);
terms implied by law (no intention required); and
terms implied by custom and usage,
and identifies #2 as the type the courts will read into a contract.  Implication of law can be from custom, for business efficiency (what is necessary in a contract), or what is reasonable (from Denning's dissent in
Liverpool City Council v Irwin
).
She finds that the Court of Appeal erred in characterizing a term implied in law as a term implied in fact, which brought in the intentionality of the parties.  Holding that the employer had a legal obligation to provide reasonable notice and that this can only be displaced by an express contrary agreement, the court imposed a reasonable term of notification on HOJ; HOJ industries.

FIREWORKS.Llama 3.1 405B,Homex Realty and Development Co. Ltd. v Wyoming (Village),I don't know.,"facts: As a condition of registration of a plan of subdivision in the Village of Wyoming, Atkinson, the owner and subdivider of the parcel of land, entered into an agreement with the Village for the installation of municipal services in the subdivision. This agreement, dated January 22, 1968, and registered September 26, 1975, provided in a general way for the owner's providing ""all the requirements financial and otherwise, of the Corporation re surfacing of roads, installation of services and drainage"". The agreement also prevented the sale of the lands in question until the agreement had been fully carried out, except with the consent of the Village, but the provision did not provide that consent would operate to release Atkinson from his obligation to the Village. Before any services were installed, Homex bought the great majority of the lots on the subdivision with the Village's consent. There was some question as to whether or not Homex had undertaken to assume the obligations of the original subdivider. Nevertheless, when protracted negotiations between the Village and Homex concerning the installation of services proved fruitless, the Village, in April 1976, pursuant to s. 29(3) (now
s. 50(3)
) of the
Planning Act
and without notice to Homex, enacted by-law 7 deeming the lots purchased by Homex not to be a registered plan of subdivision. Homex, in September 1976, made application for judicial review for an order quashing by-law 7 and, while the application was pending, checkerboarded its lots.
In November 1975, Homex and the Village negotiated the installation of services along the only street requiring them. By-law 6, enacted in December 1975, provided that it was the policy of the Village that it would neither assume responsibility for a water pipeline constructed by Homex nor permit its connection to the municipal water supply system. Homex coupled an application in judicial review to quash by-law 6 with the application for an order to quash by-law 7.
issue: What qualifies as a ""legislative"" decision such that no duty of procedural fairness applies?
decision: Appeal dismissed.
reasons: Estey, writing for the majority, held that while the passage of By-law 7 had some characteristics of a community interest, it was also clearly the culmination of the dispute between the village and Homex.  As a result he found that the decision was quasi-judicial such as to attract the principle of notice and the doctrine of
audi alteram partem
.  Despite this, however, he held that the conduct of Homex to rid itself of the obligations under the agreement with Atkinson were such that it should be denied a discretionary remedy.  There was also no basis to challenge By-law 6 as it simply stated the facts of the agreement with Atkinson.
Dickson, in the dissent, is quoted:
The courts long ago developed the general proposition that wherever a statute authorizes the interference with property or other rights and is silent as to whether or not the agency in question is required to give notice prior to the intervention in such rights, the courts will ""supply the omission of the legislature"" and require the agency in question to afford the subject an opportunity of being heard before it proceeds.
He held that an act could not be labelled ""legislative"" merely for the purpose of dispensing with fairness. It was not particularly important that the function of the municipality was classified as ""legislative"" or ""quasi-judicial"", rather, it was necessary to look at the nature of the function and to the facts of each case. The by-law in question was not of wide and general application, but was rather aimed at deliberately limiting the rights of Homex, entitling it to some procedural safeguards - at a minimum, notice of the proposed by-law and the opportunity to be heard.
ratio: In general, the courts have not imposed procedural requirements on the subordinate law-making function.
The facts of each case are key to determining the level of procedural fairness required."

Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada v Bell Canada
.  On appeal Bell is arguing that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal process is unfair because the Canadian Human Rights Commission makes regulations that the Tribunal must follow, and then appears in front of them seeking favorable decisions.  They claim that this constitutes a conflict of interest and a lack of necessary ""judicial"" independence.
issue: Does the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal lack independence and impartiality because of the power of the Canadian Human Rights Commission to issue binding guidelines for them before they appear in front of them?
decision: Appeal dismissed, case to proceed to Tribunal.
reasons: The court recognizes that Bell's claims are not without merit, however after consideration they dismiss them.  The court held that Bell did not provide sufficient evidence for their claims and also because they misunderstand impartiality - it does not mean having the freedom to decide a case however one wishes to, being subject to certain binding principles is perfectly legitimate for an impartial judiciary.  Further, the Commission cannot create guidelines that favour them in the Tribunal, because to do so would be
ultra vires
their powers given in the
Canadian Human Rights Act
and the Tribunal is not bound by any such guidelines.  The powers that the Commission has to enact guidelines under
s.27(2)
and
s.27(3)
of the
Act
are constrained as all powers to create subordinate legislation are, and therefore the system is not flawed.

FIREWORKS.Llama 3.1 405B,Catholic Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto v CM,I don't know.,"facts: The aid society took SM into protection on several occasions and supervised her mother, CM, on parenting skills. On consent, SM was made a ward of the society 1989. Throughout the wardship, the society continued to work with CM and facilitated regular visits with SM, however, bonding between mother and daughter remained minimal. In December 1989, after a second four-month wardship, the society brought a status review application seeking an order of Crown wardship without access for the purposes of adoption. CM opposed the motion and the matter was dealt with sporadically throughout 1991. In February 1992 the Ontario Provincial Court ordered that SM be returned to CM on the basis that court intervention was no longer necessary to protect the child. The judge considered CM capable of acquiring the skill to care for her daughter adequately. The society obtained a stay of the order and unsuccessfully appealed to the Ontario Court (General Division). The Court of Appeal granted a stay of the order for return pending appeal and a motion for the introduction of fresh evidence. The new evidence concerned the consistent and repeated assertions of the child that she regarded her foster family as her real family, that she did not want to see her birth mother and that attempts to implement access visits with CM had become almost impossible because of the child's negative reactions - emotional, psychological and physical.  It allowed the appeal, set aside the order for the return of the child to the mother and ordered that the child be made a Crown ward without access for the purposes of adoption. CM appealed to the Supreme Court.
issue: Does the child need continued protection?
decision: Appeal dismissed.
reasons: L'Heureux-Dubé, writing for the court, reviewed the case law and determined that when a court is determining whether the wardship should be terminated or continue, the judge should not determine whether an order of wardship should have been made in the previous or earlier hearings, but instead
now
consider whether continuation of the wardship in the current proceedings is in the best interests of the child without overlooking the parents' rights.  The review hearing is not about retrying the original need for a protection order, but rather the court should determine the circumstances of the parents or parent since the last order as it relates to the situation with respect to the child's custody, including their physical, mental and emotional state since that time and also whether there is now a lifestyle, including attitudes of the parent, that warrants the child being returned to the parent or to wardship.
She lays out a two part test:
Does the child continue to need protection and require a court order for protection?
The children's aid society must continue to justify its intervention by showing that a court order is necessary to protect the child in the future.  This does not mean that an absence of proof of a deficiency in the parent's parenting capacity is enough to return the child to the parent.  A court order may be necessary to protect the child from emotional harm which would result in future if the child were taken from its psychological parents.
What is in the best interests of the children?
This should be decided through a balancing of the considerations such as the importance of the continuity of care, the child’s physical/emotional/psychological needs, the benefit of a child's bond to his/her biological parent, as well as psychological bonding of child to his/her foster family.
The furtherance and protection of the child’s best interests must take priority over the desires and interests of the parent.
The question is not merely whether the parent has seen the light and is now prepared to be a good parent, but whether or not the parent has, in factk turned a new leaf and whether he or she is now able to give to the children the care they require?

Applying this to the case at bar, she finds there remains a need for continued protection; the child has exhibited strong resistance to seeing her birth mother, and her birth mother has difficulty recognizing SM's emotional and physical needs.  Between the lack of bonding with the birth mother and the bonding with the foster family, it would be in the best interests of the child to be made a ward of the respondent society, with a view to her adoption by her foster family.

Edgeworth alleges that it lost money on the project due to errors in the specifications and construction drawings.  It commenced proceedings for negligent misrepresentation against the engineering firm which prepared those drawings, N.D.

it is relied upon.
When Edgeworth performed the construction it was relying on N.D. Lea, not the provincial government.  Following the provisions in
London Drugs

They operated a resort lodge in Algonquin Park in the summer and lived in Toronto in the winter. Both parties worked in the business; the husband handled the finance and the wife the day-to-day operation of the lodge. When they separated in 1993, both parties were in their early 40s and all the children were under 8 years old. The wife wanted to stay home with the children given their ages. After around fifteen months of negotiation, the parties signed an agreement, wherein:
the husband kept the lodge and his start-up business;
the wife kept the matrimonial home in Toronto (worth approximately the same as the lodge at $250,000);
the husband would pay $60,000/year in child support;
a consulting agreement providing the wife with $15,000/year for five years, renewable on consent; and
a full and final release of any future spousal support claims.
After the divorce judgment was issued in 1997, the wife's childcare obligations changed and the consulting agreement was not renewed. She applied to the court for relief, including spousal support. The trial judge referred to the husband as ""manipulative"" and ""obsessive"". The application was allowed, child support was brought in line with the
Guidelines
and the wife was awarded support of $4,400/month for five years. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment regarding spousal support, and the husband was given leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.
issue: When should a support agreement be upheld by the courts?
decision: Appeal allowed; original support order stands.
reasons: Arbour and Bastarache, writing for the majority, stress finality and certainty as key principles in support agreements, citing
s. 9 of the
Divorce Act
; these are contracts and as long as they were entered into openly, the courts should enforce them.
They state that when considering whether to uphold a support agreement, there is a two stage analysis:
The formation of the agreement
: was the agreement ""unimpeachably negotiated""?
Factors to consider:
representation by counsel: the degree of professional assistance received by the party is relevant, but a court should not presume an imbalance of power.
circumstances: was one or both parties vulnerable and if so, did presence of counsel rectify this vulnerability?
duration of negotiations: was the agreement negotiated over a reasonable amount of time?
Substance of the agreement: does the agreement remain in substantial compliance with the objectives of the
Divorce Act
?
The analysis should not be restricted to the spousal support component – look at the whole agreement; the agreement as a whole should substantially comply with the factors and objectives of the
Act
(including the principles of certainty, autonomy and finality).
An agreement can be modified to bring it in line with the principles in the
Act
.
Agreement's correspondence to the parties' original intentions
: were the current circumstances anticipated when the agreement was drafted?
Foreseeability is interpreted broadly; circumstances do not have to have been explicitly considered/contemplated
Foreseeable circumstances include a change of job, assets going down in value, etc.

Generally, where negotiation of the agreement was correct and the agreement remains in substantial compliance with the
Act
, the court should defer to the wishes of the party and accord the agreement great weight.
Applying this to the case at bar:
Both parties had engaged the services of expert counsel and negotiations persisted over a lengthy period. Although the husband may have been the dominant party, the wife had adequate counsel; there was no hint of any vulnerabilities that might not be compensated by counsel.
The quantum of child support established in the agreement intended to provide the wife with a minimum amount of income in contemplation of her not working. While the wife argues that the business generates income, this was accounted for when the assets were valued and divided. The consulting contract reflects the parties' intention to provide the wife with a source of employment income for a limited time. The wife chose not to go back to the workforce, and had substantial assets even without support; there was no hardship or long-term disadvantage.
In the result, the original order should stand.
LeBel and Deschamps, in the dissent, stress very different concepts: interdependence and unequal bargaining power.  They propose a simpler test; is the agreement objectively unfair when considered now?
The dissenters disagree with the majority in two key areas.  One, the presence of counsel may not be enough to negate a power imbalance, and two, that very little deference should be given to agreements that deviate from the objectives in
s. 15.2(6)
of the
Act
; any fair agreement should reasonably realize the four stated objectives.
ratio: Establishes the test for enforcement of support agreements.
Miglin
applies only to final spousal support agreements.  A final agreement is one which limits the amount or duration of support or waives support entirely; it does not contemplate variation."

While in the 27th week of pregnancy she was driving her car when her negligent actions caused a car accident.  The fetus was permanently injured, and was born prematurely that day.  Her son, Ryan Dobson, suffered physical and mental injuries, including cerebral palsy.  His grandfather launched a tort claim for damages against his mother.  Ryan was successful at the Court of Appeal, which his mother appealed.
issue: Should a mother be liable in tort for damages to her child arising from a prenatal negligent act that allegedly injured the fetus in her womb?
decision: Appeal allowed.
reasons: Cory, writing for the majority, finds that the mother should not be held liable in the situation because of the policy implications.  They employ the
Kamloops
test to determine if a duty of care should be owed.  It has two parts:
Is the relationship between the two parties close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there any public policy implications that should negate or limit the scope of the duty?
They find that the first part is satisfied; however the public policy implications negate the duty.  They state that there are two main reasons for this: it would violate the privacy and autonomy of women, and it is impossible to judicially define a reasonable standard of conduct for pregnant women.
McLachlin, in a concurring judgment, states that another main reason why this duty cannot be imposed is that it would violate pregnant women's rights under the
Charter
– specifically liberty and equality.  They would lose their liberty, and not be treated equally with other women in society.
Major, in the dissent, states that in order for the public policy implications to negate the duty they must add new restrictions on what the woman can do.  He says that this is not the case, because she had a duty of care to everyone else on the road, and extending that to the foetus would not change the reasonable standard of her conduct.  He says that this case deals specifically with pregnant women driving automobiles, and if the creation of duty imposed a limitation on her actions that was not there previously then the outcome would be different.  He uses the example with another pregnant woman in the car – if the same outcome occurred, then there is no question that the other woman's foetus could sue her for negligence.  He agrees that the
Kamloops
test applies, but says that the policy implications here do not negate the duty.
ratio: Pregnant women do not owe a duty of care to the foetus in their womb.
The test to determine if a duty of care is owed has two parts:
Is the relationship close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there public policy grounds to negate or limit the scope of the duty?

They claim that the aboriginal title over a piece of land in British Columbia that had been present before Confederation had never been extinguished, and that the tribe therefore still had title to the land.  This claim was denied at trial and upheld at appeal.
issue: Do the alleged aboriginal land claims exist?
If the claims exist, were they extinguished?
decision: Appeal dismissed.
reasons: At trial and upon initial appeal the courts decided that if there ever was aboriginal title, it was surely extinguished upon confederation.  The Supreme Court holds that aboriginal title definitely exists, however they were split over whether or not it had been extinguished.  The majority decided that it has been extinguished by virtue of the government's exercise of control over the lands, and therefore the appeal is dismissed.  However, the dissenting judges disagree and state that more must be present to prove that the lands were extinguished.  They say that the provincial government did not have any constitutional right to deal with the land of the aboriginals, and that their predecessors before confederation did not do anything that could amount to extinguishing the lands.

OPENAI.gpt-4o,E. (Mrs.) v Eve,I don't know,"facts: Eve was a 24 year-old mentally disabled woman living in PEI with a condition that made it very difficult for her to communicate with others.  She was sent away from her mother, who cared for her, during the week so that she could attend a special school.  Her mother was seeking the court's permission to perform a sterilization procedure (hysterectomy) on her daughter.  There was considerable evidence that the daughter would be incapable of handling the burdens of motherhood.  Eve had struck up a friendship with a boy from school, and discussed marriage, and her mother is afraid of the burden that would be placed on Eve, and ultimately upon herself to look after a child if pregnancy ensued.  Permission was denied at trial, but granted at the Court of Appeal.
issue: Can a caregiver for someone incapable of giving informed consent make decisions about surgeries for the incapable individual?
decision: Appeal allowed.
reasons: La Forest, writing for a unanimous court, discusses the history of
parens patriae
jurisdiction, which states that the state is responsible for decisions concerning those that cannot give informed consent themselves. He says that the test is generally that the only procedures that will be allowed are ones that are in the ""best interests"" of the protected person. He focuses his criticism in this case on the fact that Mrs. E. is claiming that the burden on her to look after the child should be considered in making the decision. La Forest states that this should be given no consideration, as it is only the best interests of the protected person that are of concern.
He also says that arguing about the protected person's fitness as a parents involves value-loaded questions that result in a designation of disabled persons as less competent parents, even though there is significant evidence showing that they show as much fondness and concern for their children as anyone else. He also considers that the procedure of a hysterectomy is serious surgery and quite invasive, and further that Eve does not require assistance caring for her reproductive cycle, which is a concern in other cases. Perhaps most importantly, this surgery is not therapeutic.
La Forest concludes that ""the grave intrusion on a person’s rights and the certain physical damage that ensues from non-therapeutic sterilization without consent, when compared to the highly questionable advantages that can result, [show that] it can never safely be determined that such a procedure is for the benefit of the person."" The procedure should never be authorized for non-therapeutic purposes under the
parens patriae
jurisdiction.
ratio: Non-therapeutic surgeries can never be determined to be for the benefit of a person who is incapable of giving informed consent.
It is only the best interests of the disabled person concerned that are of importance; concerns of others should not be considered."

ratio: "
OPENAI.gpt-4o,DBS v SRG; LJW v TAR; Henry v Henry; Hiemstra v Hiemstra,I don't know.,"facts: Parents had three children in the course of their ten year common law relationship.  The father had sole interim custody after separation but then the parties entered into an informal shared custody arrangement where neither party paid support.  Three years later the mother brought an action in Alberta for retroactive and ongoing support.  The chambers judge awarded her prospective support but not retroactive.  The Court of Appeal allowed her appeal, but found no blameworthy conduct or willful failure to disclose on the part of the father.
Three children were born in the course of a common law relationship. After separation the children lived with the mother, and some months later the father paid $150 in child support pursuant to a maintenance agreement which was increased to $300/month following a consent order.  The mother brought an action for retroactive support.  The father had low income and high access costs and resisted the action.  The chambers judge held retroactive support would constitute hardship.
Parents married in 1984 and divorced in 1991. After separation the two children lived with their mother and a divorce judgment ordered the father to pay $700/month in child support.  In 2000 the mother signaled an intention to request increased support.  The father voluntarily increased his payments, but still below the table amount.  The mother was unaware that his income had increased dramatically as they lived in different cities.  At chambers, the judge granted her application for retroactive support based on the table amount, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal in a 2-1 judgment.
Parents divorced in 1996.  The children lived with the father, then one of the children moved to lived with the mother.  The father had a lot more income and the mother asked for an increase of support but the father rejected the request.  The mother was hesitant to take the case to court because earlier proceedings had caused a rift between the mother and children.  The chambers judge held that this was an appropriate circumstance for a retroactive award, and he calculated it from January 1, 2003 onward, to be paid in the amount of $500/month, as a ""reasonable compromise"" that best fit the situation of the parties.  The Court of Appeal upheld the decision.
All of these proceedings were merged before the Supreme Court.
issue: Who is entitled to retroactive child support?
decision: The appeals in
DBS
and
TAR
should be allowed and the decisions of the chambers judges restored.  The appeals in
Henry
and
Hiemstra
should be dismissed.
reasons: Justice Bastarache, writing for the majority, held that children are entitled to child support from both parents commensurate with their income.  To prevent liability for retroactive support, any changes in income should be reported to the custodial parent.  If this is not done and an application is brought to enforce a change, four factors should be analysed to see if retroactive support is warranted:
Undue delay: does the recipient have a reasonable excuse for not seeking support earlier?
Any voluntary, intentional choice not to apply for an increase will militate against retroactive support.  There is a balancing here; a child should not be punished for a poor choice of the parent.
Was there blameworthy conduct on the part of the payor?
This is interpreted broadly; anything that privileges the payor's interests over his/her children's right to an appropriate amount of support.
Could the payor have reasonably believed that they were discharging their support obligations?
The more significant a change in income, the more likely a court will find a payor's behaviour blameworthy if they do not proactively disclose.
Need of child/benefit: would the child benefit from retroactive award based on their needs/circumstances?
If a child's needs are being met by the current support, this will militate against a retroactive award.
Would a retroactive award cause hardship to payor?
This is a distinct element from the
s. 10
undue hardship test.
Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.

Turning to how far back retroactive payments should go, it turns on the conduct of the parents.  If there was no blameworthy behaviour, the retroactivity should go to when the custodial parent informs the payor that they are seeking additional support.  Generally there will be a limit of 3 years.  For blameworthy parents, the retroactivity should continue to when the support should have changed and did not, without limit.
As to the amount of a retroactive payment, the court should follow the
Guidelines
, but the court has broad discretion to craft a remedy that would be fair having regard to all the circumstances, including hardship on the payor.
Applying this to the cases...
This was an initial application for child support.  The parents had a shared custody arrangement that thought that meant no child support was payable (see
Contino v Leonelli-Contino
).  The incomes of the parents were relatively equal and due to the shared custody any money going to one household would simply be removed from the other.  Due to the lack of blameworthy conduct and the lack of benefit to the children, no retroactive support was awarded.
The father from whom support was being sought was low income (~$23,000/year) and he was supporting a second family.  Any retroactive award would cause his household hardship.  The access costs for him were also high.  Because of the lack of blameworthy conduct, the hardship a retroactive award would cause, and the fact that the standard of living in the custodial household was higher, no retroactive support was awarded.
In this case, the mother had broached the subject with the father but could not afford a lawyer to fight the case.  She was intimidated by her ex-husband and did not know much about his financial situation as he lived in another city.  The husband had had a huge income increase and held it from her, as well as saying that she should have managed her money better to better provide for their kids and that he was paying all he could afford.  Due to the large amount of blameworthy conduct and the large discrepancy in the amount he was paying and the table amount, the court awarded $100,000 in retroactive support.
As in
Henry
, the parties had very different incomes; the father earned more than $100,000K/year, much more than the mother, and he gave no financial support when the need arose.  The mother said she had not wanted to litigate because of the effect it had had on her daughter the last time they litigated.  The court held that the delay of mother was not unreasonable, and the father had no reasonable grounds on which to believe the level of support he was paying was reasonable, and thus the award granted at trial was upheld.
Abella, dissenting in part, had three issues with the decision of Bastarache.
The presumptive starting date of effective notice: the payor has the information on when their income changes, so it is impractical and unrealistic to expect the recipient to keep tabs on the payor’s income; the date should be when the income changes.
The role of blameworthy conduct: the conduct of the payor should be immaterial; the whole obligation depends on the income increase, conduct of the parties is irrelevant.
The three year cutoff: Abella finds this arbitrary - any cutoff of this type should be found in statute, not created by the courts.
ratio: Retroactive child support orders should no longer be rare or difficult to obtain.
Established the framework for assessing claims where there is a large, undisclosed swing in income.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?
Children are entitled to support from both parents commensurate with their ability to pay.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?
This case is sometimes referred to as the ""don't-ask-don't-tell"" case, as the
Federal Child Support Guidelines
do not require payors to update their income information each year, merely that the paying parent make disclosure at least once a year upon request of recipient parent (
s. 25
)."
OPENAI.gpt-4o,O'Grady v Sparling,I don't know,"facts: O'Grady was charged under s. 55(1) of the Manitoba
Highway Traffic Act
(now
s. 188
) which prohibited driving ""on a highway without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway"". The defendant challenged the law, claiming that it was beyond the power of the province because the federal government had ""occupied the field"" with a similar criminal provision in ss. 191/221 (now
s. 219
) of the
Criminal Code
, which prohibited driving with ""wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons"".  O'Grady was convicted at trial and an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba was dismissed.
issue: Are provincial laws relating to negligence with penal consequences criminal law and therefore
ultra vires
the province?
decision: Appeal dismissed.
reasons: Judson, writing for the majority, held that ""the power of a provincial legislature to enact legislation for the regulation of highway traffic is undoubted"".  He reaffirmed the principle that there exists a ""general area"" or ""domain"" of criminal law and the two governments can make law on the same matter by creating a distinction between the types of culpability.  He quotes from Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law:
There are only two states of mind which constitute
mens rea
, and they are intention and recklessness. The difference between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; they are opposed and it is a logical fallacy to suggest that recklessness is a degree of negligence. The common habit of lawyers to qualify the word ""negligence"" with some moral epithet such as ""wicked"", ""gross"", or ""culpable"" has been most unfortunate since it has inevitably led to great confusion of thought and of principle. It is equally misleading to speak of criminal negligence since this is merely to use an expression to explain itself.
On the facts, Judson found that there was overlap between the laws however ""there is no conflict between these provisions in the sense that they are repugnant"". The provincial law extended to include ""inadvertent negligence"" as well as regular negligence. It was enough that “the two pieces of legislation differed both in legislative purpose and legal and practical effect” to justify both of them.
ratio: The distinction between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; recklessness is when an actor does not desire harmful consequences but forsees the possibility and consciously takes the risk.
There must be an operational incompatibility between federal and provincial law to invoke paramountcy."
OPENAI.gpt-4o,Canada (Attorney General) v Mossup,I don't know,"facts: Mossop is a gay man, and his partner's father died.  He applied to take bereavement leave from his job to go to the funeral, but is denied because his partner is neither a ""spouse"" nor a ""common law partner"" as they are both required to be of the opposite sex.  He makes a claim to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, but refuses to argue sexual orientation as a ground, and instead will only argue family status, stating that all matters to do with homosexuals are not about sexual orientation by definition.  The case was dismissed in the lower courts.
issue: Can a homosexual man claim discrimination against ""family status"" with his partner under
s.3 of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
?
decision: Appeal dismissed..
reasons: The court is upset with the appellant who refused to deal with the claim on the ground of sexual orientation, which was new at the time.  However, Mossop sticks with family status.  The majority says that you cannot interpret ""family status"" to include Mossop’s situation unless you also discuss the ground of sexual orientation, and as Mossop refuses to do so he cannot be successful.
La Forest
concurs, but instead looks to the definitions in the Act and tries to figure out what the government meant to protect under ""family status"".  He determines that this specific field was not intended to be covered.
In the dissent,
L'Heureux-Dubé
says that ""family status"" should have a very broad interpretation.  She looks to the broader social context of limiting it as the majority does, and further that by looking at the plain meaning given in the statute you are really just taking the majority's opinion of the definition, which is exactly what you try to avoid in human rights issues.  She also suggests that when there are overlapping grounds, you should select the one that will succeed and proceed with that one.
ratio: Only identified grounds can be pursued in a human rights claim.
Definitions in human rights legislation are generally interpreted broadly, but the definition given by Parliament in the statute has a good deal of authority in the court's decision on what falls under the definition and what does not."
OPENAI.gpt-4o,British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v British Columbia (Council of Human Rights) (Re Grismer Estate),I don't know,"facts: The Government of British Columbia had a policy stating that it would not issue licenses to people suffering from a condition (homonymous hemianopsia (HH)) which affected eyesight.  The claimant had this condition but had driven flawlessly at work and on public roads using ""prism glasses"".  Despite this he was refused individual assessment and was not allowed to receive a license and was therefore unable to complete his job.  The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal allowed Grismer to be individually tested.  Grismer died shortly after this decision.  This was upheld by the British Columbia Supreme Court but overruled by the Court of Appeal.
issue: Does an absolute prohibition on licensing people with a visual impairment without the possibility of individual assessment constitute discrimination?
decision: Appeal allowed, standard disallowed.
reasons: The court applies the
Meiorin
test, showing that it can be used in scenarios outside of the workplace to determine if discrimination is justified.  This case passes the first part because the purpose of the standard (reasonable safety) is rationally connected to the function (issuing drivers’ licenses).  It also passes the second step because there is no evidence that the standard (no licenses for HH sufferers) was adopted for any reasons other than road safety.  However the case fails the third step as the court finds that the standard (no licenses for HH) is not reasonably necessary for the purpose (reasonable safety).  The blanket prohibition doesn't let people even attempt to show that they can drive safely.
It is clear here that the accommodation would be to allow testing.  In order to succeed the government would have had to prove that to allow testing would result to undue hardship which they failed to do.  Although there are clearly safety and cost concerns involved with testing, the government didn't put in any effort to determine these values, nor did they even look for alternative ways of testing.  The court also says that in general, with the government, costs must be exorbitant to amount to undue hardship, as they are publicly funded and this would be seen as being in the public interest.  As the standard is not rationally necessary for the purpose of reasonable road safety, it amounts to discrimination and must be removed.
ratio: The
Meiorin
test applies to all standards that are thought to be discriminatory, even if they do not occur in a workplace; called bona fide justification tests.
The government will be held to a very high threshold when claiming that the costs of not adopting a standard amount to undue hardship as they are publicly funded and preventing discrimination is in the public interest."
OPENAI.gpt-4o,Just v British Columbia,"{""facts"":"""",""ratio"":"""",""decision"":""I don't know""}","facts: Heavy snow fall forced Just and his daughter to stop in a line of traffic by a rocky slope on a major highway.  A boulder, which worked loose from the wooded slopes above the highway, came crashing down on the appellant's car, killing the appellant's daughter and causing him very serious injuries.  Just brought an action against the provincial government contending that the government negligently failed to properly maintain the highway.
The Department of Highways had set up a system for inspection and remedial work upon rock slopes.  Inspection and recommendations were made by engineers and the work was effected by a rock scaling crew responsible for performing remedial work throughout the entire province.  The department's practice had been to make visual inspections from the highway unless rock falls or a history of instability in an area indicated a need for the rock engineer to climb the slope.  Numerous informal inspections were carried out by highway personnel as they drove along the road.
The trial judge found that the entire system of inspection and the way it was implemented was a policy matter which did not give rise to liability. No finding was made as to whether or not the system of inspection was reasonable or whether the inspections themselves were properly carried out. The Court of Appeal upheld the finding of the trial judge and Just appealled to the Supreme Court.
issue: Is the government under a duty of care to maintain the highways and if so, are they liable if the highways are not sufficiently maintained?
decision: Appeal allowed, new trial ordered.
reasons: Cory, writing for the majority, held that the province owes a duty of care, which ordinarily extends to their reasonable maintenance, to those using its highways.  The Department of Highways could readily foresee the risk that harm might befall users of a highway if it were not reasonably maintained.  That maintenance could be found to extend to the prevention of injury from falling rock.
Government agencies may be exempt from the application of the traditional tort law duty of care if an explicit statutory exemption exists or if the decision arose as a result of a policy decision.  Whether or not a decision is characterized as a policy decision or as an operational decision rests on the nature of the decision and not on the identity of the actors.  Generally, decisions concerning budgetary allotments for departments or government agencies should be classified as policy decisions.  A policy decision may be open to challenge on the basis that it is not made in the bona fide exercise of discretion.  If after due consideration it is found that a duty of care is owed by the government agency and no exemption by way of statute or policy decision-making is found to exist, a traditional torts analysis ensues (as per
Anns v Merton London Borough Council
) and the issue of standard of care required of the government agency must next be considered.  The manner and quality of an inspection system, since it was clearly part of the operational aspect of a governmental activity, should be assessed when consideration is given to the standard of care issue.  At this stage, the requisite standard of care must be assessed in light of all the surrounding circumstances including budgetary restraints and the availability of qualified personnel and equipment.
Sopinka, in the dissent, held that the government had the power to carry out the inspections but was under no duty to do so.  Conduct within the limits of this discretion gives rise to no duty of care; conduct outside of these limits may attract a private law duty of care.
A litigant may not attack a policy and it is not appropriate for a Court to pass on it, absent evidence that a policy was adopted for some ulterior motive and not for a municipal purpose.  In order for a private duty to arise, it would have to be shown that the Rockwork Section acted outside its delegated discretion to determine whether to inspect and the manner in which the inspection is to be made.  Policy decisions are immune from review because they usually entail not only a decision to do something but also some call upon the public purse.  The government was acting within its discretion when it decided that inspections should be done and the manner in which they were to be done.  Responsibility for deciding the extent to which the inspection program was to be implemented was delegated to the Rockwork Section.
ratio: The duty of care should apply to a public authority unless there is a valid basis for its exclusion.
Policy decisions – the decision by the government about what acts to perform under a given statute – are exempt from liability; operational decisions – the decision by the government about how to perform those acts once they have been decided - are not exempt from liability."
OPENAI.gpt-4o,Machtinger v HOJ Industries Ltd.,I don't know.,"facts: Both appellants began working for HOJ Industries, a car dealer, in 1978, and were discharged in 1985 without cause.  At the time they were dismissed Machtinger was credit manager and rust‑proofing sales manager and Lefebvre was sales manager.  Each had entered into a contract for employment for an indefinite period which contained a clause allowing the respondent to terminate his employment without cause, in Machtinger's case without notice and in Lefebvre's case on two weeks' notice.  Under the provincial
Employment Standards Act
the appellants were entitled to a minimum notice period of four weeks.  After they were dismissed, the respondent paid each of them the equivalent of four weeks' salary.  The appellants brought action for wrongful dismissal and the trial judge found that they were entitled to reasonable notice of termination, and that the period of reasonable notice for Machtinger was 7 months and for Lefebvre, 7½ months, however this was overturned by the Court of Appeal.
issue: What should the notice period be in order to terminate employment if notice required in employment contract violates legislated standards?
decision: Appeal allowed, lower court judgment restored.
reasons: McLachlin, writing a concurring judgment, examined the legal principles governing the implication of terms.  She identifies three types of implied terms:
terms implied by fact (intention required);
terms implied by law (no intention required); and
terms implied by custom and usage,
and identifies #2 as the type the courts will read into a contract.  Implication of law can be from custom, for business efficiency (what is necessary in a contract), or what is reasonable (from Denning's dissent in
Liverpool City Council v Irwin
).
She finds that the Court of Appeal erred in characterizing a term implied in law as a term implied in fact, which brought in the intentionality of the parties.  Holding that the employer had a legal obligation to provide reasonable notice and that this can only be displaced by an express contrary agreement, the court imposed a reasonable term of notification on HOJ; HOJ industries.
ratio: Terms can be implied by the court based on:
custom or usage;
if necessary for business efficacy;
legal incidents of a particular class of contract."
OPENAI.gpt-4o,Homex Realty and Development Co. Ltd. v Wyoming (Village),I don't know.,"facts: As a condition of registration of a plan of subdivision in the Village of Wyoming, Atkinson, the owner and subdivider of the parcel of land, entered into an agreement with the Village for the installation of municipal services in the subdivision. This agreement, dated January 22, 1968, and registered September 26, 1975, provided in a general way for the owner's providing ""all the requirements financial and otherwise, of the Corporation re surfacing of roads, installation of services and drainage"". The agreement also prevented the sale of the lands in question until the agreement had been fully carried out, except with the consent of the Village, but the provision did not provide that consent would operate to release Atkinson from his obligation to the Village. Before any services were installed, Homex bought the great majority of the lots on the subdivision with the Village's consent. There was some question as to whether or not Homex had undertaken to assume the obligations of the original subdivider. Nevertheless, when protracted negotiations between the Village and Homex concerning the installation of services proved fruitless, the Village, in April 1976, pursuant to s. 29(3) (now
s. 50(3)
) of the
Planning Act
and without notice to Homex, enacted by-law 7 deeming the lots purchased by Homex not to be a registered plan of subdivision. Homex, in September 1976, made application for judicial review for an order quashing by-law 7 and, while the application was pending, checkerboarded its lots.
In November 1975, Homex and the Village negotiated the installation of services along the only street requiring them. By-law 6, enacted in December 1975, provided that it was the policy of the Village that it would neither assume responsibility for a water pipeline constructed by Homex nor permit its connection to the municipal water supply system. Homex coupled an application in judicial review to quash by-law 6 with the application for an order to quash by-law 7.
issue: What qualifies as a ""legislative"" decision such that no duty of procedural fairness applies?
decision: Appeal dismissed.
reasons: Estey, writing for the majority, held that while the passage of By-law 7 had some characteristics of a community interest, it was also clearly the culmination of the dispute between the village and Homex.  As a result he found that the decision was quasi-judicial such as to attract the principle of notice and the doctrine of
audi alteram partem
.  Despite this, however, he held that the conduct of Homex to rid itself of the obligations under the agreement with Atkinson were such that it should be denied a discretionary remedy.  There was also no basis to challenge By-law 6 as it simply stated the facts of the agreement with Atkinson.
Dickson, in the dissent, is quoted:
The courts long ago developed the general proposition that wherever a statute authorizes the interference with property or other rights and is silent as to whether or not the agency in question is required to give notice prior to the intervention in such rights, the courts will ""supply the omission of the legislature"" and require the agency in question to afford the subject an opportunity of being heard before it proceeds.
He held that an act could not be labelled ""legislative"" merely for the purpose of dispensing with fairness. It was not particularly important that the function of the municipality was classified as ""legislative"" or ""quasi-judicial"", rather, it was necessary to look at the nature of the function and to the facts of each case. The by-law in question was not of wide and general application, but was rather aimed at deliberately limiting the rights of Homex, entitling it to some procedural safeguards - at a minimum, notice of the proposed by-law and the opportunity to be heard.
ratio: In general, the courts have not imposed procedural requirements on the subordinate law-making function.
The facts of each case are key to determining the level of procedural fairness required."
OPENAI.gpt-4o,Bell Canada v Canadian Telephone Employees Association,I don't know.,"facts: This is an appeal of the decision in
Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada v Bell Canada
.  On appeal Bell is arguing that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal process is unfair because the Canadian Human Rights Commission makes regulations that the Tribunal must follow, and then appears in front of them seeking favorable decisions.  They claim that this constitutes a conflict of interest and a lack of necessary ""judicial"" independence.
issue: Does the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal lack independence and impartiality because of the power of the Canadian Human Rights Commission to issue binding guidelines for them before they appear in front of them?
decision: Appeal dismissed, case to proceed to Tribunal.
reasons: The court recognizes that Bell's claims are not without merit, however after consideration they dismiss them.  The court held that Bell did not provide sufficient evidence for their claims and also because they misunderstand impartiality - it does not mean having the freedom to decide a case however one wishes to, being subject to certain binding principles is perfectly legitimate for an impartial judiciary.  Further, the Commission cannot create guidelines that favour them in the Tribunal, because to do so would be
ultra vires
their powers given in the
Canadian Human Rights Act
and the Tribunal is not bound by any such guidelines.  The powers that the Commission has to enact guidelines under
s.27(2)
and
s.27(3)
of the
Act
are constrained as all powers to create subordinate legislation are, and therefore the system is not flawed.
ratio: Having one's decisions bound by enacted guidelines does not affect impartiality.
Agencies cannot enact subordinate legislation outside of their delegated powers."
OPENAI.gpt-4o,Catholic Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto v CM,I don't know,"facts: The aid society took SM into protection on several occasions and supervised her mother, CM, on parenting skills. On consent, SM was made a ward of the society 1989. Throughout the wardship, the society continued to work with CM and facilitated regular visits with SM, however, bonding between mother and daughter remained minimal. In December 1989, after a second four-month wardship, the society brought a status review application seeking an order of Crown wardship without access for the purposes of adoption. CM opposed the motion and the matter was dealt with sporadically throughout 1991. In February 1992 the Ontario Provincial Court ordered that SM be returned to CM on the basis that court intervention was no longer necessary to protect the child. The judge considered CM capable of acquiring the skill to care for her daughter adequately. The society obtained a stay of the order and unsuccessfully appealed to the Ontario Court (General Division). The Court of Appeal granted a stay of the order for return pending appeal and a motion for the introduction of fresh evidence. The new evidence concerned the consistent and repeated assertions of the child that she regarded her foster family as her real family, that she did not want to see her birth mother and that attempts to implement access visits with CM had become almost impossible because of the child's negative reactions - emotional, psychological and physical.  It allowed the appeal, set aside the order for the return of the child to the mother and ordered that the child be made a Crown ward without access for the purposes of adoption. CM appealed to the Supreme Court.
issue: Does the child need continued protection?
decision: Appeal dismissed.
reasons: L'Heureux-Dubé, writing for the court, reviewed the case law and determined that when a court is determining whether the wardship should be terminated or continue, the judge should not determine whether an order of wardship should have been made in the previous or earlier hearings, but instead
now
consider whether continuation of the wardship in the current proceedings is in the best interests of the child without overlooking the parents' rights.  The review hearing is not about retrying the original need for a protection order, but rather the court should determine the circumstances of the parents or parent since the last order as it relates to the situation with respect to the child's custody, including their physical, mental and emotional state since that time and also whether there is now a lifestyle, including attitudes of the parent, that warrants the child being returned to the parent or to wardship.
She lays out a two part test:
Does the child continue to need protection and require a court order for protection?
The children's aid society must continue to justify its intervention by showing that a court order is necessary to protect the child in the future.  This does not mean that an absence of proof of a deficiency in the parent's parenting capacity is enough to return the child to the parent.  A court order may be necessary to protect the child from emotional harm which would result in future if the child were taken from its psychological parents.
What is in the best interests of the children?
This should be decided through a balancing of the considerations such as the importance of the continuity of care, the child’s physical/emotional/psychological needs, the benefit of a child's bond to his/her biological parent, as well as psychological bonding of child to his/her foster family.
The furtherance and protection of the child’s best interests must take priority over the desires and interests of the parent.
The question is not merely whether the parent has seen the light and is now prepared to be a good parent, but whether or not the parent has, in factk turned a new leaf and whether he or she is now able to give to the children the care they require?

Applying this to the case at bar, she finds there remains a need for continued protection; the child has exhibited strong resistance to seeing her birth mother, and her birth mother has difficulty recognizing SM's emotional and physical needs.  Between the lack of bonding with the birth mother and the bonding with the foster family, it would be in the best interests of the child to be made a ward of the respondent society, with a view to her adoption by her foster family.
ratio: Two stage test for review of a protection order."
OPENAI.gpt-4o,Edgeworth Construction Ltd. v N.D. Lea & Associates Ltd.,I don't know.,"facts: Edgeworth Construction Ltd. was engaged in the business of building roads in British Columbia.  In 1977, it bid on a contract to build a section of highway in the Revelstoke area.  Its bid was successful, and Edgeworth entered into a contract with the province for the work.  Edgeworth alleges that it lost money on the project due to errors in the specifications and construction drawings.  It commenced proceedings for negligent misrepresentation against the engineering firm which prepared those drawings, N.D. Lea & Associates Ltd. as well as the individual engineers who affixed their seals to the drawings.
issue: Is the defendent exempt from liability due to the intervention of the Ministry and their liability clause?
decision: Appeal allowed.
reasons: McLachlin, writing for the majority, holds that liability for negligent misrepresentation occurs when a defendant:
makes a representation,
knows it will be relied upon, and
it is relied upon.
When Edgeworth performed the construction it was relying on N.D. Lea, not the provincial government.  Following the provisions in
London Drugs
the court finds there was no express or implied protection of the respondent in the contract.  Further, unlike in
London Drugs
the respondent could have drawn up a contract that protected it from liability.
ratio: Employees who are not ""powerless"" will not benefit from an employer's exemption."
OPENAI.gpt-4o,Miglin v Miglin,I don't know.,"facts: The parties were married for 14 years and had four children. They operated a resort lodge in Algonquin Park in the summer and lived in Toronto in the winter. Both parties worked in the business; the husband handled the finance and the wife the day-to-day operation of the lodge. When they separated in 1993, both parties were in their early 40s and all the children were under 8 years old. The wife wanted to stay home with the children given their ages. After around fifteen months of negotiation, the parties signed an agreement, wherein:
the husband kept the lodge and his start-up business;
the wife kept the matrimonial home in Toronto (worth approximately the same as the lodge at $250,000);
the husband would pay $60,000/year in child support;
a consulting agreement providing the wife with $15,000/year for five years, renewable on consent; and
a full and final release of any future spousal support claims.
After the divorce judgment was issued in 1997, the wife's childcare obligations changed and the consulting agreement was not renewed. She applied to the court for relief, including spousal support. The trial judge referred to the husband as ""manipulative"" and ""obsessive"". The application was allowed, child support was brought in line with the
Guidelines
and the wife was awarded support of $4,400/month for five years. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment regarding spousal support, and the husband was given leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.
issue: When should a support agreement be upheld by the courts?
decision: Appeal allowed; original support order stands.
reasons: Arbour and Bastarache, writing for the majority, stress finality and certainty as key principles in support agreements, citing
s. 9 of the
Divorce Act
; these are contracts and as long as they were entered into openly, the courts should enforce them.
They state that when considering whether to uphold a support agreement, there is a two stage analysis:
The formation of the agreement
: was the agreement ""unimpeachably negotiated""?
Factors to consider:
representation by counsel: the degree of professional assistance received by the party is relevant, but a court should not presume an imbalance of power.
circumstances: was one or both parties vulnerable and if so, did presence of counsel rectify this vulnerability?
duration of negotiations: was the agreement negotiated over a reasonable amount of time?
Substance of the agreement: does the agreement remain in substantial compliance with the objectives of the
Divorce Act
?
The analysis should not be restricted to the spousal support component – look at the whole agreement; the agreement as a whole should substantially comply with the factors and objectives of the
Act
(including the principles of certainty, autonomy and finality).
An agreement can be modified to bring it in line with the principles in the
Act
.
Agreement's correspondence to the parties' original intentions
: were the current circumstances anticipated when the agreement was drafted?
Foreseeability is interpreted broadly; circumstances do not have to have been explicitly considered/contemplated
Foreseeable circumstances include a change of job, assets going down in value, etc.

Generally, where negotiation of the agreement was correct and the agreement remains in substantial compliance with the
Act
, the court should defer to the wishes of the party and accord the agreement great weight.
Applying this to the case at bar:
Both parties had engaged the services of expert counsel and negotiations persisted over a lengthy period. Although the husband may have been the dominant party, the wife had adequate counsel; there was no hint of any vulnerabilities that might not be compensated by counsel.
The quantum of child support established in the agreement intended to provide the wife with a minimum amount of income in contemplation of her not working. While the wife argues that the business generates income, this was accounted for when the assets were valued and divided. The consulting contract reflects the parties' intention to provide the wife with a source of employment income for a limited time. The wife chose not to go back to the workforce, and had substantial assets even without support; there was no hardship or long-term disadvantage.
In the result, the original order should stand.
LeBel and Deschamps, in the dissent, stress very different concepts: interdependence and unequal bargaining power.  They propose a simpler test; is the agreement objectively unfair when considered now?
The dissenters disagree with the majority in two key areas.  One, the presence of counsel may not be enough to negate a power imbalance, and two, that very little deference should be given to agreements that deviate from the objectives in
s. 15.2(6)
of the
Act
; any fair agreement should reasonably realize the four stated objectives.
ratio: Establishes the test for enforcement of support agreements.
Miglin
applies only to final spousal support agreements.  A final agreement is one which limits the amount or duration of support or waives support entirely; it does not contemplate variation."
OPENAI.gpt-4o,Dobson v Dobson,I don't know.,"facts: Cynthia Dobson was a pregnant woman.  While in the 27th week of pregnancy she was driving her car when her negligent actions caused a car accident.  The fetus was permanently injured, and was born prematurely that day.  Her son, Ryan Dobson, suffered physical and mental injuries, including cerebral palsy.  His grandfather launched a tort claim for damages against his mother.  Ryan was successful at the Court of Appeal, which his mother appealed.
issue: Should a mother be liable in tort for damages to her child arising from a prenatal negligent act that allegedly injured the fetus in her womb?
decision: Appeal allowed.
reasons: Cory, writing for the majority, finds that the mother should not be held liable in the situation because of the policy implications.  They employ the
Kamloops
test to determine if a duty of care should be owed.  It has two parts:
Is the relationship between the two parties close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there any public policy implications that should negate or limit the scope of the duty?
They find that the first part is satisfied; however the public policy implications negate the duty.  They state that there are two main reasons for this: it would violate the privacy and autonomy of women, and it is impossible to judicially define a reasonable standard of conduct for pregnant women.
McLachlin, in a concurring judgment, states that another main reason why this duty cannot be imposed is that it would violate pregnant women's rights under the
Charter
– specifically liberty and equality.  They would lose their liberty, and not be treated equally with other women in society.
Major, in the dissent, states that in order for the public policy implications to negate the duty they must add new restrictions on what the woman can do.  He says that this is not the case, because she had a duty of care to everyone else on the road, and extending that to the foetus would not change the reasonable standard of her conduct.  He says that this case deals specifically with pregnant women driving automobiles, and if the creation of duty imposed a limitation on her actions that was not there previously then the outcome would be different.  He uses the example with another pregnant woman in the car – if the same outcome occurred, then there is no question that the other woman's foetus could sue her for negligence.  He agrees that the
Kamloops
test applies, but says that the policy implications here do not negate the duty.
ratio: Pregnant women do not owe a duty of care to the foetus in their womb.
The test to determine if a duty of care is owed has two parts:
Is the relationship close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there public policy grounds to negate or limit the scope of the duty?

ANTHROPIC.claude-3-opus-latest,Calder et al. v British Columbia (Attorney General),"{""facts"":""The case concerned the right of the Nisga'a people to their lands in British Columbia. The Nisga'a had occupied and used the lands since time immemorial, but had never signed a treaty surrendering their rights. In 1969, Frank Calder and other Nisga'a representatives brought an action against the Attorney General of British Columbia, claiming that their aboriginal title to their lands had never been lawfully extinguished."",""ratio"":""The Supreme Court of Canada recognized that aboriginal title is a legal right derived from the Indigenous peoples' historic occupation and possession of their tribal lands. The Court also found that aboriginal title existed at the time of the Royal Proclamation of 1763, and that it had not been extinguished by mere assertion of sovereignty."",""decision"":""The Court was split on whether the Nisga'a had proven their aboriginal title claim, with three judges ruling in favor, three against, and one abstaining. As a result, the Nisga'a did not succeed in this particular case. However, the recognition of aboriginal title in Calder laid the groundwork for future Indigenous land claims and the development of the modern treaty process in Canada.""}","facts: The appellants are representative of the Nishga Tribe of British Columbia.  They claim that the aboriginal title over a piece of land in British Columbia that had been present before Confederation had never been extinguished, and that the tribe therefore still had title to the land.  This claim was denied at trial and upheld at appeal.
issue: Do the alleged aboriginal land claims exist?
If the claims exist, were they extinguished?
decision: Appeal dismissed.
reasons: At trial and upon initial appeal the courts decided that if there ever was aboriginal title, it was surely extinguished upon confederation.  The Supreme Court holds that aboriginal title definitely exists, however they were split over whether or not it had been extinguished.  The majority decided that it has been extinguished by virtue of the government's exercise of control over the lands, and therefore the appeal is dismissed.  However, the dissenting judges disagree and state that more must be present to prove that the lands were extinguished.  They say that the provincial government did not have any constitutional right to deal with the land of the aboriginals, and that their predecessors before confederation did not do anything that could amount to extinguishing the lands.
ratio: Recognition of aboriginal title.
Aboriginal land claims are extinguished once government exercises control over the lands."
ANTHROPIC.claude-3-opus-latest,E. (Mrs.) v Eve,I don't know,"facts: Eve was a 24 year-old mentally disabled woman living in PEI with a condition that made it very difficult for her to communicate with others.  She was sent away from her mother, who cared for her, during the week so that she could attend a special school.  Her mother was seeking the court's permission to perform a sterilization procedure (hysterectomy) on her daughter.  There was considerable evidence that the daughter would be incapable of handling the burdens of motherhood.  Eve had struck up a friendship with a boy from school, and discussed marriage, and her mother is afraid of the burden that would be placed on Eve, and ultimately upon herself to look after a child if pregnancy ensued.  Permission was denied at trial, but granted at the Court of Appeal.
issue: Can a caregiver for someone incapable of giving informed consent make decisions about surgeries for the incapable individual?
decision: Appeal allowed.
reasons: La Forest, writing for a unanimous court, discusses the history of
parens patriae
jurisdiction, which states that the state is responsible for decisions concerning those that cannot give informed consent themselves. He says that the test is generally that the only procedures that will be allowed are ones that are in the ""best interests"" of the protected person. He focuses his criticism in this case on the fact that Mrs. E. is claiming that the burden on her to look after the child should be considered in making the decision. La Forest states that this should be given no consideration, as it is only the best interests of the protected person that are of concern.
He also says that arguing about the protected person's fitness as a parents involves value-loaded questions that result in a designation of disabled persons as less competent parents, even though there is significant evidence showing that they show as much fondness and concern for their children as anyone else. He also considers that the procedure of a hysterectomy is serious surgery and quite invasive, and further that Eve does not require assistance caring for her reproductive cycle, which is a concern in other cases. Perhaps most importantly, this surgery is not therapeutic.
La Forest concludes that ""the grave intrusion on a person’s rights and the certain physical damage that ensues from non-therapeutic sterilization without consent, when compared to the highly questionable advantages that can result, [show that] it can never safely be determined that such a procedure is for the benefit of the person."" The procedure should never be authorized for non-therapeutic purposes under the
parens patriae
jurisdiction.
ratio: Non-therapeutic surgeries can never be determined to be for the benefit of a person who is incapable of giving informed consent.
It is only the best interests of the disabled person concerned that are of importance; concerns of others should not be considered."

The father had sole interim custody after separation but then the parties entered into an informal shared custody arrangement where neither party paid support.  Three years later the mother brought an action in Alberta for retroactive and ongoing support.  The chambers judge awarded her prospective support but not retroactive.  The Court of Appeal allowed her appeal, but found no blameworthy conduct or willful failure to disclose on the part of the father.
Three children were born in the course of a common law relationship. After separation the children lived with the mother, and some months later the father paid $150 in child support pursuant to a maintenance agreement which was increased to $300/month following a consent order.  The mother brought an action for retroactive support.  The father had low income and high access costs and resisted the action.  The chambers judge held retroactive support would constitute hardship.
Parents married in 1984 and divorced in 1991. After separation the two children lived with their mother and a divorce judgment ordered the father to pay $700/month in child support.  In 2000 the mother signaled an intention to request increased support.  The father voluntarily increased his payments, but still below the table amount.  The mother was unaware that his income had increased dramatically as they lived in different cities.  At chambers, the judge granted her application for retroactive support based on the table amount, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal in a 2-1 judgment.
Parents divorced in 1996.  The children lived with the father, then one of the children moved to lived with the mother.  The father had a lot more income and the mother asked for an increase of support but the father rejected the request.  The mother was hesitant to take the case to court because earlier proceedings had caused a rift between the mother and children.  The chambers judge held that this was an appropriate circumstance for a retroactive award, and he calculated it from January 1, 2003 onward, to be paid in the amount of $500/month, as a ""reasonable compromise"" that best fit the situation of the parties.  The Court of Appeal upheld the decision.
All of these proceedings were merged before the Supreme Court.
issue: Who is entitled to retroactive child support?
decision: The appeals in
DBS
and
TAR
should be allowed and the decisions of the chambers judges restored.  The appeals in
Henry
and
Hiemstra
should be dismissed.
reasons: Justice Bastarache, writing for the majority, held that children are entitled to child support from both parents commensurate with their income.  To prevent liability for retroactive support, any changes in income should be reported to the custodial parent.  If this is not done and an application is brought to enforce a change, four factors should be analysed to see if retroactive support is warranted:
Undue delay: does the recipient have a reasonable excuse for not seeking support earlier?
Any voluntary, intentional choice not to apply for an increase will militate against retroactive support.  There is a balancing here; a child should not be punished for a poor choice of the parent.
Was there blameworthy conduct on the part of the payor?
This is interpreted broadly; anything that privileges the payor's interests over his/her children's right to an appropriate amount of support.
Could the payor have reasonably believed that they were discharging their support obligations?
The more significant a change in income, the more likely a court will find a payor's behaviour blameworthy if they do not proactively disclose.
Need of child/benefit: would the child benefit from retroactive award based on their needs/circumstances?
If a child's needs are being met by the current support, this will militate against a retroactive award.
Would a retroactive award cause hardship to payor?
This is a distinct element from the
s. 10
undue hardship test.
Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.

undue hardship test.
Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.
Turning to how far back retroactive payments should go, it turns on the conduct of the parents.  If there was no blameworthy behaviour, the retroactivity should go to when the custodial parent informs the payor that they are seeking additional support.  Generally there will be a limit of 3 years.  For blameworthy parents, the retroactivity should continue to when the support should have changed and did not, without limit.
As to the amount of a retroactive payment, the court should follow the
Guidelines
, but the court has broad discretion to craft a remedy that would be fair having regard to all the circumstances, including hardship on the payor.
Applying this to the cases...
This was an initial application for child support.  The parents had a shared custody arrangement that thought that meant no child support was payable (see
Contino v Leonelli-Contino
).  The incomes of the parents were relatively equal and due to the shared custody any money going to one household would simply be removed from the other.  Due to the lack of blameworthy conduct and the lack of benefit to the children, no retroactive support was awarded.
The father from whom support was being sought was low income (~$23,000/year) and he was supporting a second family.  Any retroactive award would cause his household hardship.  The access costs for him were also high.  Because of the lack of blameworthy conduct, the hardship a retroactive award would cause, and the fact that the standard of living in the custodial household was higher, no retroactive support was awarded.
In this case, the mother had broached the subject with the father but could not afford a lawyer to fight the case.  She was intimidated by her ex-husband and did not know much about his financial situation as he lived in another city.  The husband had had a huge income increase and held it from her, as well as saying that she should have managed her money better to better provide for their kids and that he was paying all he could afford.  Due to the large amount of blameworthy conduct and the large discrepancy in the amount he was paying and the table amount, the court awarded $100,000 in retroactive support.
As in
Henry
, the parties had very different incomes; the father earned more than $100,000K/year, much more than the mother, and he gave no financial support when the need arose.  The mother said she had not wanted to litigate because of the effect it had had on her daughter the last time they litigated.  The court held that the delay of mother was not unreasonable, and the father had no reasonable grounds on which to believe the level of support he was paying was reasonable, and thus the award granted at trial was upheld.
Abella, dissenting in part, had three issues with the decision of Bastarache.
The presumptive starting date of effective notice: the payor has the information on when their income changes, so it is impractical and unrealistic to expect the recipient to keep tabs on the payor’s income; the date should be when the income changes.
The role of blameworthy conduct: the conduct of the payor should be immaterial; the whole obligation depends on the income increase, conduct of the parties is irrelevant.
The three year cutoff: Abella finds this arbitrary - any cutoff of this type should be found in statute, not created by the courts.
ratio: Retroactive child support orders should no longer be rare or difficult to obtain.
Established the framework for assessing claims where there is a large, undisclosed swing in income.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?
Children are entitled to support from both parents commensurate with their ability to pay.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?
This case is sometimes referred to as the ""don't-ask-don't-tell"" case, as the
Federal Child Support Guidelines
do not require payors to update their income information each year, merely that the paying parent make disclosure at least once a year upon request of recipient parent (
s. 25
)."
ANTHROPIC.claude-3-opus-latest,O'Grady v Sparling,I don't know,"facts: O'Grady was charged under s. 55(1) of the Manitoba
Highway Traffic Act
(now
s. 188
) which prohibited driving ""on a highway without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway"". The defendant challenged the law, claiming that it was beyond the power of the province because the federal government had ""occupied the field"" with a similar criminal provision in ss. 191/221 (now
s. 219
) of the
Criminal Code
, which prohibited driving with ""wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons"".  O'Grady was convicted at trial and an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba was dismissed.
issue: Are provincial laws relating to negligence with penal consequences criminal law and therefore
ultra vires
the province?
decision: Appeal dismissed.
reasons: Judson, writing for the majority, held that ""the power of a provincial legislature to enact legislation for the regulation of highway traffic is undoubted"".  He reaffirmed the principle that there exists a ""general area"" or ""domain"" of criminal law and the two governments can make law on the same matter by creating a distinction between the types of culpability.  He quotes from Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law:
There are only two states of mind which constitute
mens rea
, and they are intention and recklessness. The difference between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; they are opposed and it is a logical fallacy to suggest that recklessness is a degree of negligence. The common habit of lawyers to qualify the word ""negligence"" with some moral epithet such as ""wicked"", ""gross"", or ""culpable"" has been most unfortunate since it has inevitably led to great confusion of thought and of principle. It is equally misleading to speak of criminal negligence since this is merely to use an expression to explain itself.
On the facts, Judson found that there was overlap between the laws however ""there is no conflict between these provisions in the sense that they are repugnant"". The provincial law extended to include ""inadvertent negligence"" as well as regular negligence. It was enough that “the two pieces of legislation differed both in legislative purpose and legal and practical effect” to justify both of them.
ratio: The distinction between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; recklessness is when an actor does not desire harmful consequences but forsees the possibility and consciously takes the risk.
There must be an operational incompatibility between federal and provincial law to invoke paramountcy."
ANTHROPIC.claude-3-opus-latest,Canada (Attorney General) v Mossup,I don't know,"facts: Mossop is a gay man, and his partner's father died.  He applied to take bereavement leave from his job to go to the funeral, but is denied because his partner is neither a ""spouse"" nor a ""common law partner"" as they are both required to be of the opposite sex.  He makes a claim to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, but refuses to argue sexual orientation as a ground, and instead will only argue family status, stating that all matters to do with homosexuals are not about sexual orientation by definition.  The case was dismissed in the lower courts.
issue: Can a homosexual man claim discrimination against ""family status"" with his partner under
s.3 of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
?
decision: Appeal dismissed..
reasons: The court is upset with the appellant who refused to deal with the claim on the ground of sexual orientation, which was new at the time.  However, Mossop sticks with family status.  The majority says that you cannot interpret ""family status"" to include Mossop’s situation unless you also discuss the ground of sexual orientation, and as Mossop refuses to do so he cannot be successful.
La Forest
concurs, but instead looks to the definitions in the Act and tries to figure out what the government meant to protect under ""family status"".  He determines that this specific field was not intended to be covered.
In the dissent,
L'Heureux-Dubé
says that ""family status"" should have a very broad interpretation.  She looks to the broader social context of limiting it as the majority does, and further that by looking at the plain meaning given in the statute you are really just taking the majority's opinion of the definition, which is exactly what you try to avoid in human rights issues.  She also suggests that when there are overlapping grounds, you should select the one that will succeed and proceed with that one.
ratio: Only identified grounds can be pursued in a human rights claim.
Definitions in human rights legislation are generally interpreted broadly, but the definition given by Parliament in the statute has a good deal of authority in the court's decision on what falls under the definition and what does not."
ANTHROPIC.claude-3-opus-latest,British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v British Columbia (Council of Human Rights) (Re Grismer Estate),"{""facts"":""Terry Grismer was an asymptomatic individual with homonymous hemianopia (H.H.), a visual disability that reduces a person's peripheral vision. The B.C. Superintendent of Motor Vehicles cancelled his driver's licence on the grounds that his condition made him incapable of meeting the standard for peripheral vision required by the Superintendent's guidelines. The B.C. Council of Human Rights held that the Superintendent had unjustifiably discriminated against Grismer based on physical disability."",""ratio"":""The Superintendent was required to show that it had accommodated Grismer to the point of undue hardship. The Superintendent failed to prove that it had done so, as it had not adduced any evidence of the actual risk posed by Grismer's condition, but rather had treated H.H. as an absolute bar to holding a driver's licence."",""decision"":""The Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the appeal and upheld the decision of the B.C. Council of Human Rights. The Court found that the Superintendent had not justified its refusal to accommodate Grismer.""}","facts: The Government of British Columbia had a policy stating that it would not issue licenses to people suffering from a condition (homonymous hemianopsia (HH)) which affected eyesight.  The claimant had this condition but had driven flawlessly at work and on public roads using ""prism glasses"".  Despite this he was refused individual assessment and was not allowed to receive a license and was therefore unable to complete his job.  The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal allowed Grismer to be individually tested.  Grismer died shortly after this decision.  This was upheld by the British Columbia Supreme Court but overruled by the Court of Appeal.
issue: Does an absolute prohibition on licensing people with a visual impairment without the possibility of individual assessment constitute discrimination?
decision: Appeal allowed, standard disallowed.
reasons: The court applies the
Meiorin
test, showing that it can be used in scenarios outside of the workplace to determine if discrimination is justified.  This case passes the first part because the purpose of the standard (reasonable safety) is rationally connected to the function (issuing drivers’ licenses).  It also passes the second step because there is no evidence that the standard (no licenses for HH sufferers) was adopted for any reasons other than road safety.  However the case fails the third step as the court finds that the standard (no licenses for HH) is not reasonably necessary for the purpose (reasonable safety).  The blanket prohibition doesn't let people even attempt to show that they can drive safely.
It is clear here that the accommodation would be to allow testing.  In order to succeed the government would have had to prove that to allow testing would result to undue hardship which they failed to do.  Although there are clearly safety and cost concerns involved with testing, the government didn't put in any effort to determine these values, nor did they even look for alternative ways of testing.  The court also says that in general, with the government, costs must be exorbitant to amount to undue hardship, as they are publicly funded and this would be seen as being in the public interest.  As the standard is not rationally necessary for the purpose of reasonable road safety, it amounts to discrimination and must be removed.
ratio: The
Meiorin
test applies to all standards that are thought to be discriminatory, even if they do not occur in a workplace; called bona fide justification tests.
The government will be held to a very high threshold when claiming that the costs of not adopting a standard amount to undue hardship as they are publicly funded and preventing discrimination is in the public interest."
ANTHROPIC.claude-3-opus-latest,Just v British Columbia,I don't know,"facts: Heavy snow fall forced Just and his daughter to stop in a line of traffic by a rocky slope on a major highway.  A boulder, which worked loose from the wooded slopes above the highway, came crashing down on the appellant's car, killing the appellant's daughter and causing him very serious injuries.  Just brought an action against the provincial government contending that the government negligently failed to properly maintain the highway.
The Department of Highways had set up a system for inspection and remedial work upon rock slopes.  Inspection and recommendations were made by engineers and the work was effected by a rock scaling crew responsible for performing remedial work throughout the entire province.  The department's practice had been to make visual inspections from the highway unless rock falls or a history of instability in an area indicated a need for the rock engineer to climb the slope.  Numerous informal inspections were carried out by highway personnel as they drove along the road.
The trial judge found that the entire system of inspection and the way it was implemented was a policy matter which did not give rise to liability. No finding was made as to whether or not the system of inspection was reasonable or whether the inspections themselves were properly carried out. The Court of Appeal upheld the finding of the trial judge and Just appealled to the Supreme Court.
issue: Is the government under a duty of care to maintain the highways and if so, are they liable if the highways are not sufficiently maintained?
decision: Appeal allowed, new trial ordered.
reasons: Cory, writing for the majority, held that the province owes a duty of care, which ordinarily extends to their reasonable maintenance, to those using its highways.  The Department of Highways could readily foresee the risk that harm might befall users of a highway if it were not reasonably maintained.  That maintenance could be found to extend to the prevention of injury from falling rock.
Government agencies may be exempt from the application of the traditional tort law duty of care if an explicit statutory exemption exists or if the decision arose as a result of a policy decision.  Whether or not a decision is characterized as a policy decision or as an operational decision rests on the nature of the decision and not on the identity of the actors.  Generally, decisions concerning budgetary allotments for departments or government agencies should be classified as policy decisions.  A policy decision may be open to challenge on the basis that it is not made in the bona fide exercise of discretion.  If after due consideration it is found that a duty of care is owed by the government agency and no exemption by way of statute or policy decision-making is found to exist, a traditional torts analysis ensues (as per
Anns v Merton London Borough Council
) and the issue of standard of care required of the government agency must next be considered.  The manner and quality of an inspection system, since it was clearly part of the operational aspect of a governmental activity, should be assessed when consideration is given to the standard of care issue.  At this stage, the requisite standard of care must be assessed in light of all the surrounding circumstances including budgetary restraints and the availability of qualified personnel and equipment.
Sopinka, in the dissent, held that the government had the power to carry out the inspections but was under no duty to do so.  Conduct within the limits of this discretion gives rise to no duty of care; conduct outside of these limits may attract a private law duty of care.
A litigant may not attack a policy and it is not appropriate for a Court to pass on it, absent evidence that a policy was adopted for some ulterior motive and not for a municipal purpose.  In order for a private duty to arise, it would have to be shown that the Rockwork Section acted outside its delegated discretion to determine whether to inspect and the manner in which the inspection is to be made.  Policy decisions are immune from review because they usually entail not only a decision to do something but also some call upon the public purse.  The government was acting within its discretion when it decided that inspections should be done and the manner in which they were to be done.  Responsibility for deciding the extent to which the inspection program was to be implemented was delegated to the Rockwork Section.
ratio: The duty of care should apply to a public authority unless there is a valid basis for its exclusion.
Policy decisions – the decision by the government about what acts to perform under a given statute – are exempt from liability; operational decisions – the decision by the government about how to perform those acts once they have been decided - are not exempt from liability."
ANTHROPIC.claude-3-opus-latest,Machtinger v HOJ Industries Ltd.,I don't know,"facts: Both appellants began working for HOJ Industries, a car dealer, in 1978, and were discharged in 1985 without cause.  At the time they were dismissed Machtinger was credit manager and rust‑proofing sales manager and Lefebvre was sales manager.  Each had entered into a contract for employment for an indefinite period which contained a clause allowing the respondent to terminate his employment without cause, in Machtinger's case without notice and in Lefebvre's case on two weeks' notice.  Under the provincial
Employment Standards Act
the appellants were entitled to a minimum notice period of four weeks.  After they were dismissed, the respondent paid each of them the equivalent of four weeks' salary.  The appellants brought action for wrongful dismissal and the trial judge found that they were entitled to reasonable notice of termination, and that the period of reasonable notice for Machtinger was 7 months and for Lefebvre, 7½ months, however this was overturned by the Court of Appeal.
issue: What should the notice period be in order to terminate employment if notice required in employment contract violates legislated standards?
decision: Appeal allowed, lower court judgment restored.
reasons: McLachlin, writing a concurring judgment, examined the legal principles governing the implication of terms.  She identifies three types of implied terms:
terms implied by fact (intention required);
terms implied by law (no intention required); and
terms implied by custom and usage,
and identifies #2 as the type the courts will read into a contract.  Implication of law can be from custom, for business efficiency (what is necessary in a contract), or what is reasonable (from Denning's dissent in
Liverpool City Council v Irwin
).
She finds that the Court of Appeal erred in characterizing a term implied in law as a term implied in fact, which brought in the intentionality of the parties.  Holding that the employer had a legal obligation to provide reasonable notice and that this can only be displaced by an express contrary agreement, the court imposed a reasonable term of notification on HOJ; HOJ industries.
ratio: Terms can be implied by the court based on:
custom or usage;
if necessary for business efficacy;
legal incidents of a particular class of contract."
ANTHROPIC.claude-3-opus-latest,Homex Realty and Development Co. Ltd. v Wyoming (Village),I don't know,"facts: As a condition of registration of a plan of subdivision in the Village of Wyoming, Atkinson, the owner and subdivider of the parcel of land, entered into an agreement with the Village for the installation of municipal services in the subdivision. This agreement, dated January 22, 1968, and registered September 26, 1975, provided in a general way for the owner's providing ""all the requirements financial and otherwise, of the Corporation re surfacing of roads, installation of services and drainage"". The agreement also prevented the sale of the lands in question until the agreement had been fully carried out, except with the consent of the Village, but the provision did not provide that consent would operate to release Atkinson from his obligation to the Village. Before any services were installed, Homex bought the great majority of the lots on the subdivision with the Village's consent. There was some question as to whether or not Homex had undertaken to assume the obligations of the original subdivider. Nevertheless, when protracted negotiations between the Village and Homex concerning the installation of services proved fruitless, the Village, in April 1976, pursuant to s. 29(3) (now
s. 50(3)
) of the
Planning Act
and without notice to Homex, enacted by-law 7 deeming the lots purchased by Homex not to be a registered plan of subdivision. Homex, in September 1976, made application for judicial review for an order quashing by-law 7 and, while the application was pending, checkerboarded its lots.
In November 1975, Homex and the Village negotiated the installation of services along the only street requiring them. By-law 6, enacted in December 1975, provided that it was the policy of the Village that it would neither assume responsibility for a water pipeline constructed by Homex nor permit its connection to the municipal water supply system. Homex coupled an application in judicial review to quash by-law 6 with the application for an order to quash by-law 7.
issue: What qualifies as a ""legislative"" decision such that no duty of procedural fairness applies?
decision: Appeal dismissed.
reasons: Estey, writing for the majority, held that while the passage of By-law 7 had some characteristics of a community interest, it was also clearly the culmination of the dispute between the village and Homex.  As a result he found that the decision was quasi-judicial such as to attract the principle of notice and the doctrine of
audi alteram partem
.  Despite this, however, he held that the conduct of Homex to rid itself of the obligations under the agreement with Atkinson were such that it should be denied a discretionary remedy.  There was also no basis to challenge By-law 6 as it simply stated the facts of the agreement with Atkinson.
Dickson, in the dissent, is quoted:
The courts long ago developed the general proposition that wherever a statute authorizes the interference with property or other rights and is silent as to whether or not the agency in question is required to give notice prior to the intervention in such rights, the courts will ""supply the omission of the legislature"" and require the agency in question to afford the subject an opportunity of being heard before it proceeds.
He held that an act could not be labelled ""legislative"" merely for the purpose of dispensing with fairness. It was not particularly important that the function of the municipality was classified as ""legislative"" or ""quasi-judicial"", rather, it was necessary to look at the nature of the function and to the facts of each case. The by-law in question was not of wide and general application, but was rather aimed at deliberately limiting the rights of Homex, entitling it to some procedural safeguards - at a minimum, notice of the proposed by-law and the opportunity to be heard.
ratio: In general, the courts have not imposed procedural requirements on the subordinate law-making function.
The facts of each case are key to determining the level of procedural fairness required."

Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada v Bell Canada
.  On appeal Bell is arguing that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal process is unfair because the Canadian Human Rights Commission makes regulations that the Tribunal must follow, and then appears in front of them seeking favorable decisions.  They claim that this constitutes a conflict of interest and a lack of necessary ""judicial"" independence.
issue: Does the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal lack independence and impartiality because of the power of the Canadian Human Rights Commission to issue binding guidelines for them before they appear in front of them?
decision: Appeal dismissed, case to proceed to Tribunal.
reasons: The court recognizes that Bell's claims are not without merit, however after consideration they dismiss them.  The court held that Bell did not provide sufficient evidence for their claims and also because they misunderstand impartiality - it does not mean having the freedom to decide a case however one wishes to, being subject to certain binding principles is perfectly legitimate for an impartial judiciary.  Further, the Commission cannot create guidelines that favour them in the Tribunal, because to do so would be
ultra vires
their powers given in the
Canadian Human Rights Act
and the Tribunal is not bound by any such guidelines.  The powers that the Commission has to enact guidelines under
s.27(2)
and
s.27(3)
of the
Act
are constrained as all powers to create subordinate legislation are, and therefore the system is not flawed.

ANTHROPIC.claude-3-opus-latest,Catholic Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto v CM,"{""facts"":""The appellant society apprehended a child born to a mother with a mild intellectual disability.

Separating a child from a parent because of the parent's particular disability, absent other concerns, implicates both the equality rights of the parent and the child's best interests. The mother alone cannot meet the special needs of her child. The grandparents can, however, and they offer the additional advantage of being the child's biological family. Although bonding between the child and the prospective adoptive parents is an important consideration, it cannot be permitted to override all other considerations."",""decision"":""Appeal allowed.""}","facts: The aid society took SM into protection on several occasions and supervised her mother, CM, on parenting skills. On consent, SM was made a ward of the society 1989. Throughout the wardship, the society continued to work with CM and facilitated regular visits with SM, however, bonding between mother and daughter remained minimal. In December 1989, after a second four-month wardship, the society brought a status review application seeking an order of Crown wardship without access for the purposes of adoption. CM opposed the motion and the matter was dealt with sporadically throughout 1991. In February 1992 the Ontario Provincial Court ordered that SM be returned to CM on the basis that court intervention was no longer necessary to protect the child. The judge considered CM capable of acquiring the skill to care for her daughter adequately. The society obtained a stay of the order and unsuccessfully appealed to the Ontario Court (General Division). The Court of Appeal granted a stay of the order for return pending appeal and a motion for the introduction of fresh evidence. The new evidence concerned the consistent and repeated assertions of the child that she regarded her foster family as her real family, that she did not want to see her birth mother and that attempts to implement access visits with CM had become almost impossible because of the child's negative reactions - emotional, psychological and physical.  It allowed the appeal, set aside the order for the return of the child to the mother and ordered that the child be made a Crown ward without access for the purposes of adoption. CM appealed to the Supreme Court.
issue: Does the child need continued protection?
decision: Appeal dismissed.
reasons: L'Heureux-Dubé, writing for the court, reviewed the case law and determined that when a court is determining whether the wardship should be terminated or continue, the judge should not determine whether an order of wardship should have been made in the previous or earlier hearings, but instead
now
consider whether continuation of the wardship in the current proceedings is in the best interests of the child without overlooking the parents' rights.  The review hearing is not about retrying the original need for a protection order, but rather the court should determine the circumstances of the parents or parent since the last order as it relates to the situation with respect to the child's custody, including their physical, mental and emotional state since that time and also whether there is now a lifestyle, including attitudes of the parent, that warrants the child being returned to the parent or to wardship.
She lays out a two part test:
Does the child continue to need protection and require a court order for protection?
The children's aid society must continue to justify its intervention by showing that a court order is necessary to protect the child in the future.  This does not mean that an absence of proof of a deficiency in the parent's parenting capacity is enough to return the child to the parent.  A court order may be necessary to protect the child from emotional harm which would result in future if the child were taken from its psychological parents.
What is in the best interests of the children?
This should be decided through a balancing of the considerations such as the importance of the continuity of care, the child’s physical/emotional/psychological needs, the benefit of a child's bond to his/her biological parent, as well as psychological bonding of child to his/her foster family.
The furtherance and protection of the child’s best interests must take priority over the desires and interests of the parent.
The question is not merely whether the parent has seen the light and is now prepared to be a good parent, but whether or not the parent has, in factk turned a new leaf and whether he or she is now able to give to the children the care they require?

In 1977, it bid on a contract to build a section of highway in the Revelstoke area.  Its bid was successful, and Edgeworth entered into a contract with the province for the work.  Edgeworth alleges that it lost money on the project due to errors in the specifications and construction drawings.  It commenced proceedings for negligent misrepresentation against the engineering firm which prepared those drawings, N.D. Lea & Associates Ltd. as well as the individual engineers who affixed their seals to the drawings.
issue: Is the defendent exempt from liability due to the intervention of the Ministry and their liability clause?
decision: Appeal allowed.
reasons: McLachlin, writing for the majority, holds that liability for negligent misrepresentation occurs when a defendant:
makes a representation,
knows it will be relied upon, and
it is relied upon.
When Edgeworth performed the construction it was relying on N.D. Lea, not the provincial government.  Following the provisions in
London Drugs
the court finds there was no express or implied protection of the respondent in the contract.  Further, unlike in
London Drugs
the respondent could have drawn up a contract that protected it from liability.

ANTHROPIC.claude-3-opus-latest,Miglin v Miglin,I don't know,"facts: The parties were married for 14 years and had four children. They operated a resort lodge in Algonquin Park in the summer and lived in Toronto in the winter. Both parties worked in the business; the husband handled the finance and the wife the day-to-day operation of the lodge. When they separated in 1993, both parties were in their early 40s and all the children were under 8 years old. The wife wanted to stay home with the children given their ages. After around fifteen months of negotiation, the parties signed an agreement, wherein:
the husband kept the lodge and his start-up business;
the wife kept the matrimonial home in Toronto (worth approximately the same as the lodge at $250,000);
the husband would pay $60,000/year in child support;
a consulting agreement providing the wife with $15,000/year for five years, renewable on consent; and
a full and final release of any future spousal support claims.
After the divorce judgment was issued in 1997, the wife's childcare obligations changed and the consulting agreement was not renewed. She applied to the court for relief, including spousal support. The trial judge referred to the husband as ""manipulative"" and ""obsessive"". The application was allowed, child support was brought in line with the
Guidelines
and the wife was awarded support of $4,400/month for five years. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment regarding spousal support, and the husband was given leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.
issue: When should a support agreement be upheld by the courts?
decision: Appeal allowed; original support order stands.
reasons: Arbour and Bastarache, writing for the majority, stress finality and certainty as key principles in support agreements, citing
s. 9 of the
Divorce Act
; these are contracts and as long as they were entered into openly, the courts should enforce them.
They state that when considering whether to uphold a support agreement, there is a two stage analysis:
The formation of the agreement
: was the agreement ""unimpeachably negotiated""?
Factors to consider:
representation by counsel: the degree of professional assistance received by the party is relevant, but a court should not presume an imbalance of power.
circumstances: was one or both parties vulnerable and if so, did presence of counsel rectify this vulnerability?
duration of negotiations: was the agreement negotiated over a reasonable amount of time?
Substance of the agreement: does the agreement remain in substantial compliance with the objectives of the
Divorce Act
?
The analysis should not be restricted to the spousal support component – look at the whole agreement; the agreement as a whole should substantially comply with the factors and objectives of the
Act
(including the principles of certainty, autonomy and finality).
An agreement can be modified to bring it in line with the principles in the
Act
.
Agreement's correspondence to the parties' original intentions
: were the current circumstances anticipated when the agreement was drafted?
Foreseeability is interpreted broadly; circumstances do not have to have been explicitly considered/contemplated
Foreseeable circumstances include a change of job, assets going down in value, etc.

Generally, where negotiation of the agreement was correct and the agreement remains in substantial compliance with the
Act
, the court should defer to the wishes of the party and accord the agreement great weight.
Applying this to the case at bar:
Both parties had engaged the services of expert counsel and negotiations persisted over a lengthy period. Although the husband may have been the dominant party, the wife had adequate counsel; there was no hint of any vulnerabilities that might not be compensated by counsel.
The quantum of child support established in the agreement intended to provide the wife with a minimum amount of income in contemplation of her not working. While the wife argues that the business generates income, this was accounted for when the assets were valued and divided. The consulting contract reflects the parties' intention to provide the wife with a source of employment income for a limited time. The wife chose not to go back to the workforce, and had substantial assets even without support; there was no hardship or long-term disadvantage.
In the result, the original order should stand.
LeBel and Deschamps, in the dissent, stress very different concepts: interdependence and unequal bargaining power.  They propose a simpler test; is the agreement objectively unfair when considered now?
The dissenters disagree with the majority in two key areas.  One, the presence of counsel may not be enough to negate a power imbalance, and two, that very little deference should be given to agreements that deviate from the objectives in
s. 15.2(6)
of the
Act
; any fair agreement should reasonably realize the four stated objectives.
ratio: Establishes the test for enforcement of support agreements.
Miglin
applies only to final spousal support agreements.  A final agreement is one which limits the amount or duration of support or waives support entirely; it does not contemplate variation."
ANTHROPIC.claude-3-opus-latest,Dobson v Dobson,I don't know,"facts: Cynthia Dobson was a pregnant woman.  While in the 27th week of pregnancy she was driving her car when her negligent actions caused a car accident.  The fetus was permanently injured, and was born prematurely that day.  Her son, Ryan Dobson, suffered physical and mental injuries, including cerebral palsy.  His grandfather launched a tort claim for damages against his mother.  Ryan was successful at the Court of Appeal, which his mother appealed.
issue: Should a mother be liable in tort for damages to her child arising from a prenatal negligent act that allegedly injured the fetus in her womb?
decision: Appeal allowed.
reasons: Cory, writing for the majority, finds that the mother should not be held liable in the situation because of the policy implications.  They employ the
Kamloops
test to determine if a duty of care should be owed.  It has two parts:
Is the relationship between the two parties close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there any public policy implications that should negate or limit the scope of the duty?
They find that the first part is satisfied; however the public policy implications negate the duty.  They state that there are two main reasons for this: it would violate the privacy and autonomy of women, and it is impossible to judicially define a reasonable standard of conduct for pregnant women.
McLachlin, in a concurring judgment, states that another main reason why this duty cannot be imposed is that it would violate pregnant women's rights under the
Charter
– specifically liberty and equality.  They would lose their liberty, and not be treated equally with other women in society.
Major, in the dissent, states that in order for the public policy implications to negate the duty they must add new restrictions on what the woman can do.  He says that this is not the case, because she had a duty of care to everyone else on the road, and extending that to the foetus would not change the reasonable standard of her conduct.  He says that this case deals specifically with pregnant women driving automobiles, and if the creation of duty imposed a limitation on her actions that was not there previously then the outcome would be different.  He uses the example with another pregnant woman in the car – if the same outcome occurred, then there is no question that the other woman's foetus could sue her for negligence.  He agrees that the
Kamloops
test applies, but says that the policy implications here do not negate the duty.
ratio: Pregnant women do not owe a duty of care to the foetus in their womb.
The test to determine if a duty of care is owed has two parts:
Is the relationship close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there public policy grounds to negate or limit the scope of the duty?

This claim was denied at trial and upheld at appeal.
issue: Do the alleged aboriginal land claims exist?
If the claims exist, were they extinguished?
decision: Appeal dismissed.
reasons: At trial and upon initial appeal the courts decided that if there ever was aboriginal title, it was surely extinguished upon confederation.  The Supreme Court holds that aboriginal title definitely exists, however they were split over whether or not it had been extinguished.  The majority decided that it has been extinguished by virtue of the government's exercise of control over the lands, and therefore the appeal is dismissed.  However, the dissenting judges disagree and state that more must be present to prove that the lands were extinguished.  They say that the provincial government did not have any constitutional right to deal with the land of the aboriginals, and that their predecessors before confederation did not do anything that could amount to extinguishing the lands.
ratio: Recognition of aboriginal title.
Aboriginal land claims are extinguished once government exercises control over the lands."
GEMINI.gemini-1.5-flash,E. (Mrs.) v Eve,I don't know ,"facts: Eve was a 24 year-old mentally disabled woman living in PEI with a condition that made it very difficult for her to communicate with others.  She was sent away from her mother, who cared for her, during the week so that she could attend a special school.  Her mother was seeking the court's permission to perform a sterilization procedure (hysterectomy) on her daughter.  There was considerable evidence that the daughter would be incapable of handling the burdens of motherhood.  Eve had struck up a friendship with a boy from school, and discussed marriage, and her mother is afraid of the burden that would be placed on Eve, and ultimately upon herself to look after a child if pregnancy ensued.  Permission was denied at trial, but granted at the Court of Appeal.
issue: Can a caregiver for someone incapable of giving informed consent make decisions about surgeries for the incapable individual?
decision: Appeal allowed.
reasons: La Forest, writing for a unanimous court, discusses the history of
parens patriae
jurisdiction, which states that the state is responsible for decisions concerning those that cannot give informed consent themselves. He says that the test is generally that the only procedures that will be allowed are ones that are in the ""best interests"" of the protected person. He focuses his criticism in this case on the fact that Mrs. E. is claiming that the burden on her to look after the child should be considered in making the decision. La Forest states that this should be given no consideration, as it is only the best interests of the protected person that are of concern.
He also says that arguing about the protected person's fitness as a parents involves value-loaded questions that result in a designation of disabled persons as less competent parents, even though there is significant evidence showing that they show as much fondness and concern for their children as anyone else. He also considers that the procedure of a hysterectomy is serious surgery and quite invasive, and further that Eve does not require assistance caring for her reproductive cycle, which is a concern in other cases. Perhaps most importantly, this surgery is not therapeutic.
La Forest concludes that ""the grave intrusion on a person’s rights and the certain physical damage that ensues from non-therapeutic sterilization without consent, when compared to the highly questionable advantages that can result, [show that] it can never safely be determined that such a procedure is for the benefit of the person."" The procedure should never be authorized for non-therapeutic purposes under the
parens patriae
jurisdiction.
ratio: Non-therapeutic surgeries can never be determined to be for the benefit of a person who is incapable of giving informed consent.
It is only the best interests of the disabled person concerned that are of importance; concerns of others should not be considered."

GEMINI.gemini-1.5-flash,DBS v SRG; LJW v TAR; Henry v Henry; Hiemstra v Hiemstra,I don't know ,"facts: Parents had three children in the course of their ten year common law relationship.  The father had sole interim custody after separation but then the parties entered into an informal shared custody arrangement where neither party paid support.  Three years later the mother brought an action in Alberta for retroactive and ongoing support.  The chambers judge awarded her prospective support but not retroactive.  The Court of Appeal allowed her appeal, but found no blameworthy conduct or willful failure to disclose on the part of the father.
Three children were born in the course of a common law relationship. After separation the children lived with the mother, and some months later the father paid $150 in child support pursuant to a maintenance agreement which was increased to $300/month following a consent order.  The mother brought an action for retroactive support.  The father had low income and high access costs and resisted the action.  The chambers judge held retroactive support would constitute hardship.
Parents married in 1984 and divorced in 1991. After separation the two children lived with their mother and a divorce judgment ordered the father to pay $700/month in child support.  In 2000 the mother signaled an intention to request increased support.  The father voluntarily increased his payments, but still below the table amount.  The mother was unaware that his income had increased dramatically as they lived in different cities.  At chambers, the judge granted her application for retroactive support based on the table amount, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal in a 2-1 judgment.
Parents divorced in 1996.  The children lived with the father, then one of the children moved to lived with the mother.  The father had a lot more income and the mother asked for an increase of support but the father rejected the request.  The mother was hesitant to take the case to court because earlier proceedings had caused a rift between the mother and children.  The chambers judge held that this was an appropriate circumstance for a retroactive award, and he calculated it from January 1, 2003 onward, to be paid in the amount of $500/month, as a ""reasonable compromise"" that best fit the situation of the parties.  The Court of Appeal upheld the decision.
All of these proceedings were merged before the Supreme Court.
issue: Who is entitled to retroactive child support?
decision: The appeals in
DBS
and
TAR
should be allowed and the decisions of the chambers judges restored.  The appeals in
Henry
and
Hiemstra
should be dismissed.
reasons: Justice Bastarache, writing for the majority, held that children are entitled to child support from both parents commensurate with their income.  To prevent liability for retroactive support, any changes in income should be reported to the custodial parent.  If this is not done and an application is brought to enforce a change, four factors should be analysed to see if retroactive support is warranted:
Undue delay: does the recipient have a reasonable excuse for not seeking support earlier?
Any voluntary, intentional choice not to apply for an increase will militate against retroactive support.  There is a balancing here; a child should not be punished for a poor choice of the parent.
Was there blameworthy conduct on the part of the payor?
This is interpreted broadly; anything that privileges the payor's interests over his/her children's right to an appropriate amount of support.
Could the payor have reasonably believed that they were discharging their support obligations?
The more significant a change in income, the more likely a court will find a payor's behaviour blameworthy if they do not proactively disclose.
Need of child/benefit: would the child benefit from retroactive award based on their needs/circumstances?
If a child's needs are being met by the current support, this will militate against a retroactive award.
Would a retroactive award cause hardship to payor?
This is a distinct element from the
s. 10
undue hardship test.
Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.

If there was no blameworthy behaviour, the retroactivity should go to when the custodial parent informs the payor that they are seeking additional support.  Generally there will be a limit of 3 years.  For blameworthy parents, the retroactivity should continue to when the support should have changed and did not, without limit.
As to the amount of a retroactive payment, the court should follow the
Guidelines
, but the court has broad discretion to craft a remedy that would be fair having regard to all the circumstances, including hardship on the payor.
Applying this to the cases...
This was an initial application for child support.  The parents had a shared custody arrangement that thought that meant no child support was payable (see
Contino v Leonelli-Contino
).  The incomes of the parents were relatively equal and due to the shared custody any money going to one household would simply be removed from the other.  Due to the lack of blameworthy conduct and the lack of benefit to the children, no retroactive support was awarded.
The father from whom support was being sought was low income (~$23,000/year) and he was supporting a second family.  Any retroactive award would cause his household hardship.  The access costs for him were also high.  Because of the lack of blameworthy conduct, the hardship a retroactive award would cause, and the fact that the standard of living in the custodial household was higher, no retroactive support was awarded.
In this case, the mother had broached the subject with the father but could not afford a lawyer to fight the case.  She was intimidated by her ex-husband and did not know much about his financial situation as he lived in another city.  The husband had had a huge income increase and held it from her, as well as saying that she should have managed her money better to better provide for their kids and that he was paying all he could afford.  Due to the large amount of blameworthy conduct and the large discrepancy in the amount he was paying and the table amount, the court awarded $100,000 in retroactive support.
As in
Henry
, the parties had very different incomes; the father earned more than $100,000K/year, much more than the mother, and he gave no financial support when the need arose.  The mother said she had not wanted to litigate because of the effect it had had on her daughter the last time they litigated.  The court held that the delay of mother was not unreasonable, and the father had no reasonable grounds on which to believe the level of support he was paying was reasonable, and thus the award granted at trial was upheld.
Abella, dissenting in part, had three issues with the decision of Bastarache.
The presumptive starting date of effective notice: the payor has the information on when their income changes, so it is impractical and unrealistic to expect the recipient to keep tabs on the payor’s income; the date should be when the income changes.
The role of blameworthy conduct: the conduct of the payor should be immaterial; the whole obligation depends on the income increase, conduct of the parties is irrelevant.
The three year cutoff: Abella finds this arbitrary - any cutoff of this type should be found in statute, not created by the courts.
ratio: Retroactive child support orders should no longer be rare or difficult to obtain.
Established the framework for assessing claims where there is a large, undisclosed swing in income.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?
Children are entitled to support from both parents commensurate with their ability to pay.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?
This case is sometimes referred to as the ""don't-ask-don't-tell"" case, as the
Federal Child Support Guidelines
do not require payors to update their income information each year, merely that the paying parent make disclosure at least once a year upon request of recipient parent (
s. 25
)."
GEMINI.gemini-1.5-flash,O'Grady v Sparling,I don't know ,"facts: O'Grady was charged under s. 55(1) of the Manitoba
Highway Traffic Act
(now
s. 188
) which prohibited driving ""on a highway without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway"". The defendant challenged the law, claiming that it was beyond the power of the province because the federal government had ""occupied the field"" with a similar criminal provision in ss. 191/221 (now
s. 219
) of the
Criminal Code
, which prohibited driving with ""wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons"".  O'Grady was convicted at trial and an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba was dismissed.
issue: Are provincial laws relating to negligence with penal consequences criminal law and therefore
ultra vires
the province?
decision: Appeal dismissed.
reasons: Judson, writing for the majority, held that ""the power of a provincial legislature to enact legislation for the regulation of highway traffic is undoubted"".  He reaffirmed the principle that there exists a ""general area"" or ""domain"" of criminal law and the two governments can make law on the same matter by creating a distinction between the types of culpability.  He quotes from Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law:
There are only two states of mind which constitute
mens rea
, and they are intention and recklessness. The difference between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; they are opposed and it is a logical fallacy to suggest that recklessness is a degree of negligence. The common habit of lawyers to qualify the word ""negligence"" with some moral epithet such as ""wicked"", ""gross"", or ""culpable"" has been most unfortunate since it has inevitably led to great confusion of thought and of principle. It is equally misleading to speak of criminal negligence since this is merely to use an expression to explain itself.
On the facts, Judson found that there was overlap between the laws however ""there is no conflict between these provisions in the sense that they are repugnant"". The provincial law extended to include ""inadvertent negligence"" as well as regular negligence. It was enough that “the two pieces of legislation differed both in legislative purpose and legal and practical effect” to justify both of them.
ratio: The distinction between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; recklessness is when an actor does not desire harmful consequences but forsees the possibility and consciously takes the risk.
There must be an operational incompatibility between federal and provincial law to invoke paramountcy."
GEMINI.gemini-1.5-flash,Canada (Attorney General) v Mossup,"{""facts"":""Founding member of  Mossup partnership requested cancellation of partnership in 1943; business partner's shares were deemed cancelled at time of partnership's constitution in 1929, prior to  particular pieces of legislation, so the cancellation dated back to that time.

He applied to take bereavement leave from his job to go to the funeral, but is denied because his partner is neither a ""spouse"" nor a ""common law partner"" as they are both required to be of the opposite sex.  He makes a claim to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, but refuses to argue sexual orientation as a ground, and instead will only argue family status, stating that all matters to do with homosexuals are not about sexual orientation by definition.  The case was dismissed in the lower courts.
issue: Can a homosexual man claim discrimination against ""family status"" with his partner under
s.3 of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
?
decision: Appeal dismissed..
reasons: The court is upset with the appellant who refused to deal with the claim on the ground of sexual orientation, which was new at the time.  However, Mossop sticks with family status.  The majority says that you cannot interpret ""family status"" to include Mossop’s situation unless you also discuss the ground of sexual orientation, and as Mossop refuses to do so he cannot be successful.
La Forest
concurs, but instead looks to the definitions in the Act and tries to figure out what the government meant to protect under ""family status"".  He determines that this specific field was not intended to be covered.
In the dissent,
L'Heureux-Dubé
says that ""family status"" should have a very broad interpretation.  She looks to the broader social context of limiting it as the majority does, and further that by looking at the plain meaning given in the statute you are really just taking the majority's opinion of the definition, which is exactly what you try to avoid in human rights issues.  She also suggests that when there are overlapping grounds, you should select the one that will succeed and proceed with that one.
ratio: Only identified grounds can be pursued in a human rights claim.
Definitions in human rights legislation are generally interpreted broadly, but the definition given by Parliament in the statute has a good deal of authority in the court's decision on what falls under the definition and what does not."
GEMINI.gemini-1.5-flash,British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v British Columbia (Council of Human Rights) (Re Grismer Estate),"```json {""facts"": ""Grismer, a visually impaired person, was refused a driver's license.  The Superintendent of Motor Vehicles argued that granting a license would be unsafe. The Council of Human Rights found this discriminatory under the Code."", ""ratio"": ""The Court held that the Superintendent's refusal to issue a driver's license was discriminatory, but justified under s. 15(2) of the Charter because it was a reasonable limit demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society, based on the importance of public safety."", ""decision"": ""The appeal of the Superintendent was allowed. The decision of the Council of Human Rights was overturned.""} ``` ","facts: The Government of British Columbia had a policy stating that it would not issue licenses to people suffering from a condition (homonymous hemianopsia (HH)) which affected eyesight.  The claimant had this condition but had driven flawlessly at work and on public roads using ""prism glasses"".  Despite this he was refused individual assessment and was not allowed to receive a license and was therefore unable to complete his job.  The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal allowed Grismer to be individually tested.  Grismer died shortly after this decision.  This was upheld by the British Columbia Supreme Court but overruled by the Court of Appeal.
issue: Does an absolute prohibition on licensing people with a visual impairment without the possibility of individual assessment constitute discrimination?
decision: Appeal allowed, standard disallowed.
reasons: The court applies the
Meiorin
test, showing that it can be used in scenarios outside of the workplace to determine if discrimination is justified.  This case passes the first part because the purpose of the standard (reasonable safety) is rationally connected to the function (issuing drivers’ licenses).  It also passes the second step because there is no evidence that the standard (no licenses for HH sufferers) was adopted for any reasons other than road safety.  However the case fails the third step as the court finds that the standard (no licenses for HH) is not reasonably necessary for the purpose (reasonable safety).  The blanket prohibition doesn't let people even attempt to show that they can drive safely.
It is clear here that the accommodation would be to allow testing.  In order to succeed the government would have had to prove that to allow testing would result to undue hardship which they failed to do.  Although there are clearly safety and cost concerns involved with testing, the government didn't put in any effort to determine these values, nor did they even look for alternative ways of testing.  The court also says that in general, with the government, costs must be exorbitant to amount to undue hardship, as they are publicly funded and this would be seen as being in the public interest.  As the standard is not rationally necessary for the purpose of reasonable road safety, it amounts to discrimination and must be removed.
ratio: The
Meiorin
test applies to all standards that are thought to be discriminatory, even if they do not occur in a workplace; called bona fide justification tests.
The government will be held to a very high threshold when claiming that the costs of not adopting a standard amount to undue hardship as they are publicly funded and preventing discrimination is in the public interest."
GEMINI.gemini-1.5-flash,Just v British Columbia,I don't know ,"facts: Heavy snow fall forced Just and his daughter to stop in a line of traffic by a rocky slope on a major highway.  A boulder, which worked loose from the wooded slopes above the highway, came crashing down on the appellant's car, killing the appellant's daughter and causing him very serious injuries.  Just brought an action against the provincial government contending that the government negligently failed to properly maintain the highway.
The Department of Highways had set up a system for inspection and remedial work upon rock slopes.  Inspection and recommendations were made by engineers and the work was effected by a rock scaling crew responsible for performing remedial work throughout the entire province.  The department's practice had been to make visual inspections from the highway unless rock falls or a history of instability in an area indicated a need for the rock engineer to climb the slope.  Numerous informal inspections were carried out by highway personnel as they drove along the road.
The trial judge found that the entire system of inspection and the way it was implemented was a policy matter which did not give rise to liability. No finding was made as to whether or not the system of inspection was reasonable or whether the inspections themselves were properly carried out. The Court of Appeal upheld the finding of the trial judge and Just appealled to the Supreme Court.
issue: Is the government under a duty of care to maintain the highways and if so, are they liable if the highways are not sufficiently maintained?
decision: Appeal allowed, new trial ordered.
reasons: Cory, writing for the majority, held that the province owes a duty of care, which ordinarily extends to their reasonable maintenance, to those using its highways.  The Department of Highways could readily foresee the risk that harm might befall users of a highway if it were not reasonably maintained.  That maintenance could be found to extend to the prevention of injury from falling rock.
Government agencies may be exempt from the application of the traditional tort law duty of care if an explicit statutory exemption exists or if the decision arose as a result of a policy decision.  Whether or not a decision is characterized as a policy decision or as an operational decision rests on the nature of the decision and not on the identity of the actors.  Generally, decisions concerning budgetary allotments for departments or government agencies should be classified as policy decisions.  A policy decision may be open to challenge on the basis that it is not made in the bona fide exercise of discretion.  If after due consideration it is found that a duty of care is owed by the government agency and no exemption by way of statute or policy decision-making is found to exist, a traditional torts analysis ensues (as per
Anns v Merton London Borough Council
) and the issue of standard of care required of the government agency must next be considered.  The manner and quality of an inspection system, since it was clearly part of the operational aspect of a governmental activity, should be assessed when consideration is given to the standard of care issue.  At this stage, the requisite standard of care must be assessed in light of all the surrounding circumstances including budgetary restraints and the availability of qualified personnel and equipment.
Sopinka, in the dissent, held that the government had the power to carry out the inspections but was under no duty to do so.  Conduct within the limits of this discretion gives rise to no duty of care; conduct outside of these limits may attract a private law duty of care.
A litigant may not attack a policy and it is not appropriate for a Court to pass on it, absent evidence that a policy was adopted for some ulterior motive and not for a municipal purpose.  In order for a private duty to arise, it would have to be shown that the Rockwork Section acted outside its delegated discretion to determine whether to inspect and the manner in which the inspection is to be made.  Policy decisions are immune from review because they usually entail not only a decision to do something but also some call upon the public purse.  The government was acting within its discretion when it decided that inspections should be done and the manner in which they were to be done.  Responsibility for deciding the extent to which the inspection program was to be implemented was delegated to the Rockwork Section.
ratio: The duty of care should apply to a public authority unless there is a valid basis for its exclusion.
Policy decisions – the decision by the government about what acts to perform under a given statute – are exempt from liability; operational decisions – the decision by the government about how to perform those acts once they have been decided - are not exempt from liability."

At the time they were dismissed Machtinger was credit manager and rust‑proofing sales manager and Lefebvre was sales manager.  Each had entered into a contract for employment for an indefinite period which contained a clause allowing the respondent to terminate his employment without cause, in Machtinger's case without notice and in Lefebvre's case on two weeks' notice.  Under the provincial
Employment Standards Act
the appellants were entitled to a minimum notice period of four weeks.  After they were dismissed, the respondent paid each of them the equivalent of four weeks' salary.  The appellants brought action for wrongful dismissal and the trial judge found that they were entitled to reasonable notice of termination, and that the period of reasonable notice for Machtinger was 7 months and for Lefebvre, 7½ months, however this was overturned by the Court of Appeal.
issue: What should the notice period be in order to terminate employment if notice required in employment contract violates legislated standards?
decision: Appeal allowed, lower court judgment restored.
reasons: McLachlin, writing a concurring judgment, examined the legal principles governing the implication of terms.  She identifies three types of implied terms:
terms implied by fact (intention required);
terms implied by law (no intention required); and
terms implied by custom and usage,
and identifies #2 as the type the courts will read into a contract.  Implication of law can be from custom, for business efficiency (what is necessary in a contract), or what is reasonable (from Denning's dissent in
Liverpool City Council v Irwin
).
She finds that the Court of Appeal erred in characterizing a term implied in law as a term implied in fact, which brought in the intentionality of the parties.  Holding that the employer had a legal obligation to provide reasonable notice and that this can only be displaced by an express contrary agreement, the court imposed a reasonable term of notification on HOJ; HOJ industries.
ratio: Terms can be implied by the court based on:
custom or usage;
if necessary for business efficacy;
legal incidents of a particular class of contract."
GEMINI.gemini-1.5-flash,Homex Realty and Development Co. Ltd. v Wyoming (Village),I don't know ,"facts: As a condition of registration of a plan of subdivision in the Village of Wyoming, Atkinson, the owner and subdivider of the parcel of land, entered into an agreement with the Village for the installation of municipal services in the subdivision. This agreement, dated January 22, 1968, and registered September 26, 1975, provided in a general way for the owner's providing ""all the requirements financial and otherwise, of the Corporation re surfacing of roads, installation of services and drainage"". The agreement also prevented the sale of the lands in question until the agreement had been fully carried out, except with the consent of the Village, but the provision did not provide that consent would operate to release Atkinson from his obligation to the Village. Before any services were installed, Homex bought the great majority of the lots on the subdivision with the Village's consent. There was some question as to whether or not Homex had undertaken to assume the obligations of the original subdivider. Nevertheless, when protracted negotiations between the Village and Homex concerning the installation of services proved fruitless, the Village, in April 1976, pursuant to s. 29(3) (now
s. 50(3)
) of the
Planning Act
and without notice to Homex, enacted by-law 7 deeming the lots purchased by Homex not to be a registered plan of subdivision. Homex, in September 1976, made application for judicial review for an order quashing by-law 7 and, while the application was pending, checkerboarded its lots.
In November 1975, Homex and the Village negotiated the installation of services along the only street requiring them. By-law 6, enacted in December 1975, provided that it was the policy of the Village that it would neither assume responsibility for a water pipeline constructed by Homex nor permit its connection to the municipal water supply system. Homex coupled an application in judicial review to quash by-law 6 with the application for an order to quash by-law 7.
issue: What qualifies as a ""legislative"" decision such that no duty of procedural fairness applies?
decision: Appeal dismissed.
reasons: Estey, writing for the majority, held that while the passage of By-law 7 had some characteristics of a community interest, it was also clearly the culmination of the dispute between the village and Homex.  As a result he found that the decision was quasi-judicial such as to attract the principle of notice and the doctrine of
audi alteram partem
.  Despite this, however, he held that the conduct of Homex to rid itself of the obligations under the agreement with Atkinson were such that it should be denied a discretionary remedy.  There was also no basis to challenge By-law 6 as it simply stated the facts of the agreement with Atkinson.
Dickson, in the dissent, is quoted:
The courts long ago developed the general proposition that wherever a statute authorizes the interference with property or other rights and is silent as to whether or not the agency in question is required to give notice prior to the intervention in such rights, the courts will ""supply the omission of the legislature"" and require the agency in question to afford the subject an opportunity of being heard before it proceeds.
He held that an act could not be labelled ""legislative"" merely for the purpose of dispensing with fairness. It was not particularly important that the function of the municipality was classified as ""legislative"" or ""quasi-judicial"", rather, it was necessary to look at the nature of the function and to the facts of each case. The by-law in question was not of wide and general application, but was rather aimed at deliberately limiting the rights of Homex, entitling it to some procedural safeguards - at a minimum, notice of the proposed by-law and the opportunity to be heard.
ratio: In general, the courts have not imposed procedural requirements on the subordinate law-making function.
The facts of each case are key to determining the level of procedural fairness required."

issue: Does the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal lack independence and impartiality because of the power of the Canadian Human Rights Commission to issue binding guidelines for them before they appear in front of them?
decision: Appeal dismissed, case to proceed to Tribunal.
reasons: The court recognizes that Bell's claims are not without merit, however after consideration they dismiss them.  The court held that Bell did not provide sufficient evidence for their claims and also because they misunderstand impartiality - it does not mean having the freedom to decide a case however one wishes to, being subject to certain binding principles is perfectly legitimate for an impartial judiciary.  Further, the Commission cannot create guidelines that favour them in the Tribunal, because to do so would be
ultra vires

Canadian Human Rights Act
and the Tribunal is not bound by any such guidelines.  The powers that the Commission has to enact guidelines under

On consent, SM was made a ward of the society 1989. Throughout the wardship, the society continued to work with CM and facilitated regular visits with SM, however, bonding between mother and daughter remained minimal. In December 1989, after a second four-month wardship, the society brought a status review application seeking an order of Crown wardship without access for the purposes of adoption. CM opposed the motion and the matter was dealt with sporadically throughout 1991. In February 1992 the Ontario Provincial Court ordered that SM be returned to CM on the basis that court intervention was no longer necessary to protect the child. The judge considered CM capable of acquiring the skill to care for her daughter adequately. The society obtained a stay of the order and unsuccessfully appealed to the Ontario Court (General Division). The Court of Appeal granted a stay of the order for return pending appeal and a motion for the introduction of fresh evidence. The new evidence concerned the consistent and repeated assertions of the child that she regarded her foster family as her real family, that she did not want to see her birth mother and that attempts to implement access visits with CM had become almost impossible because of the child's negative reactions - emotional, psychological and physical.  It allowed the appeal, set aside the order for the return of the child to the mother and ordered that the child be made a Crown ward without access for the purposes of adoption. CM appealed to the Supreme Court.
issue: Does the child need continued protection?
decision: Appeal dismissed.
reasons: L'Heureux-Dubé, writing for the court, reviewed the case law and determined that when a court is determining whether the wardship should be terminated or continue, the judge should not determine whether an order of wardship should have been made in the previous or earlier hearings, but instead
now
consider whether continuation of the wardship in the current proceedings is in the best interests of the child without overlooking the parents' rights.  The review hearing is not about retrying the original need for a protection order, but rather the court should determine the circumstances of the parents or parent since the last order as it relates to the situation with respect to the child's custody, including their physical, mental and emotional state since that time and also whether there is now a lifestyle, including attitudes of the parent, that warrants the child being returned to the parent or to wardship.
She lays out a two part test:
Does the child continue to need protection and require a court order for protection?
The children's aid society must continue to justify its intervention by showing that a court order is necessary to protect the child in the future.  This does not mean that an absence of proof of a deficiency in the parent's parenting capacity is enough to return the child to the parent.  A court order may be necessary to protect the child from emotional harm which would result in future if the child were taken from its psychological parents.
What is in the best interests of the children?
This should be decided through a balancing of the considerations such as the importance of the continuity of care, the child’s physical/emotional/psychological needs, the benefit of a child's bond to his/her biological parent, as well as psychological bonding of child to his/her foster family.
The furtherance and protection of the child’s best interests must take priority over the desires and interests of the parent.
The question is not merely whether the parent has seen the light and is now prepared to be a good parent, but whether or not the parent has, in factk turned a new leaf and whether he or she is now able to give to the children the care they require?

GEMINI.gemini-1.5-flash,Miglin v Miglin,I don't know ,"facts: The parties were married for 14 years and had four children. They operated a resort lodge in Algonquin Park in the summer and lived in Toronto in the winter. Both parties worked in the business; the husband handled the finance and the wife the day-to-day operation of the lodge. When they separated in 1993, both parties were in their early 40s and all the children were under 8 years old. The wife wanted to stay home with the children given their ages. After around fifteen months of negotiation, the parties signed an agreement, wherein:
the husband kept the lodge and his start-up business;
the wife kept the matrimonial home in Toronto (worth approximately the same as the lodge at $250,000);
the husband would pay $60,000/year in child support;
a consulting agreement providing the wife with $15,000/year for five years, renewable on consent; and
a full and final release of any future spousal support claims.
After the divorce judgment was issued in 1997, the wife's childcare obligations changed and the consulting agreement was not renewed. She applied to the court for relief, including spousal support. The trial judge referred to the husband as ""manipulative"" and ""obsessive"". The application was allowed, child support was brought in line with the
Guidelines
and the wife was awarded support of $4,400/month for five years. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment regarding spousal support, and the husband was given leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.
issue: When should a support agreement be upheld by the courts?
decision: Appeal allowed; original support order stands.
reasons: Arbour and Bastarache, writing for the majority, stress finality and certainty as key principles in support agreements, citing
s. 9 of the
Divorce Act
; these are contracts and as long as they were entered into openly, the courts should enforce them.
They state that when considering whether to uphold a support agreement, there is a two stage analysis:
The formation of the agreement
: was the agreement ""unimpeachably negotiated""?
Factors to consider:
representation by counsel: the degree of professional assistance received by the party is relevant, but a court should not presume an imbalance of power.
circumstances: was one or both parties vulnerable and if so, did presence of counsel rectify this vulnerability?
duration of negotiations: was the agreement negotiated over a reasonable amount of time?
Substance of the agreement: does the agreement remain in substantial compliance with the objectives of the
Divorce Act
?
The analysis should not be restricted to the spousal support component – look at the whole agreement; the agreement as a whole should substantially comply with the factors and objectives of the
Act
(including the principles of certainty, autonomy and finality).
An agreement can be modified to bring it in line with the principles in the
Act
.
Agreement's correspondence to the parties' original intentions
: were the current circumstances anticipated when the agreement was drafted?
Foreseeability is interpreted broadly; circumstances do not have to have been explicitly considered/contemplated
Foreseeable circumstances include a change of job, assets going down in value, etc.

Generally, where negotiation of the agreement was correct and the agreement remains in substantial compliance with the
Act
, the court should defer to the wishes of the party and accord the agreement great weight.
Applying this to the case at bar:
Both parties had engaged the services of expert counsel and negotiations persisted over a lengthy period. Although the husband may have been the dominant party, the wife had adequate counsel; there was no hint of any vulnerabilities that might not be compensated by counsel.
The quantum of child support established in the agreement intended to provide the wife with a minimum amount of income in contemplation of her not working. While the wife argues that the business generates income, this was accounted for when the assets were valued and divided. The consulting contract reflects the parties' intention to provide the wife with a source of employment income for a limited time. The wife chose not to go back to the workforce, and had substantial assets even without support; there was no hardship or long-term disadvantage.
In the result, the original order should stand.
LeBel and Deschamps, in the dissent, stress very different concepts: interdependence and unequal bargaining power.  They propose a simpler test; is the agreement objectively unfair when considered now?
The dissenters disagree with the majority in two key areas.  One, the presence of counsel may not be enough to negate a power imbalance, and two, that very little deference should be given to agreements that deviate from the objectives in
s. 15.2(6)
of the
Act
; any fair agreement should reasonably realize the four stated objectives.
ratio: Establishes the test for enforcement of support agreements.
Miglin
applies only to final spousal support agreements.  A final agreement is one which limits the amount or duration of support or waives support entirely; it does not contemplate variation."
GEMINI.gemini-1.5-flash,Dobson v Dobson,I don't know ,"facts: Cynthia Dobson was a pregnant woman.  While in the 27th week of pregnancy she was driving her car when her negligent actions caused a car accident.  The fetus was permanently injured, and was born prematurely that day.  Her son, Ryan Dobson, suffered physical and mental injuries, including cerebral palsy.  His grandfather launched a tort claim for damages against his mother.  Ryan was successful at the Court of Appeal, which his mother appealed.
issue: Should a mother be liable in tort for damages to her child arising from a prenatal negligent act that allegedly injured the fetus in her womb?
decision: Appeal allowed.
reasons: Cory, writing for the majority, finds that the mother should not be held liable in the situation because of the policy implications.  They employ the
Kamloops
test to determine if a duty of care should be owed.  It has two parts:
Is the relationship between the two parties close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there any public policy implications that should negate or limit the scope of the duty?
They find that the first part is satisfied; however the public policy implications negate the duty.  They state that there are two main reasons for this: it would violate the privacy and autonomy of women, and it is impossible to judicially define a reasonable standard of conduct for pregnant women.
McLachlin, in a concurring judgment, states that another main reason why this duty cannot be imposed is that it would violate pregnant women's rights under the
Charter
– specifically liberty and equality.  They would lose their liberty, and not be treated equally with other women in society.
Major, in the dissent, states that in order for the public policy implications to negate the duty they must add new restrictions on what the woman can do.  He says that this is not the case, because she had a duty of care to everyone else on the road, and extending that to the foetus would not change the reasonable standard of her conduct.  He says that this case deals specifically with pregnant women driving automobiles, and if the creation of duty imposed a limitation on her actions that was not there previously then the outcome would be different.  He uses the example with another pregnant woman in the car – if the same outcome occurred, then there is no question that the other woman's foetus could sue her for negligence.  He agrees that the
Kamloops
test applies, but says that the policy implications here do not negate the duty.
ratio: Pregnant women do not owe a duty of care to the foetus in their womb.
The test to determine if a duty of care is owed has two parts:

MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,Calder et al. v British Columbia (Attorney General),"{""facts"":""The case involved a challenge to the validity of certain sections of the Community Charter, a British Columbia statute that regulated municipalities. The petitioners argued that these sections infringed upon their constitutional rights as guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms."",""ratio"":""The court held that the impugned provisions of the Community Charter did not infringe the petitioners' constitutional rights. The court reasoned that the provisions were a valid exercise of the provincial government's power to regulate municipalities and did not unjustifiably infringe upon the petitioners' rights."",""decision"":""The court dismissed the petitioners' application for judicial review. The impugned provisions of the Community Charter were upheld as constitutional.""}","facts: The appellants are representative of the Nishga Tribe of British Columbia.  They claim that the aboriginal title over a piece of land in British Columbia that had been present before Confederation had never been extinguished, and that the tribe therefore still had title to the land.  This claim was denied at trial and upheld at appeal.
issue: Do the alleged aboriginal land claims exist?
If the claims exist, were they extinguished?
decision: Appeal dismissed.
reasons: At trial and upon initial appeal the courts decided that if there ever was aboriginal title, it was surely extinguished upon confederation.  The Supreme Court holds that aboriginal title definitely exists, however they were split over whether or not it had been extinguished.  The majority decided that it has been extinguished by virtue of the government's exercise of control over the lands, and therefore the appeal is dismissed.  However, the dissenting judges disagree and state that more must be present to prove that the lands were extinguished.  They say that the provincial government did not have any constitutional right to deal with the land of the aboriginals, and that their predecessors before confederation did not do anything that could amount to extinguishing the lands.
ratio: Recognition of aboriginal title.
Aboriginal land claims are extinguished once government exercises control over the lands."

The egg was fertilized with the sperm of Mrs. E's husband, and then implanted in Mrs. E's uterus. Mrs. E gave birth to a baby girl, but unfortunately, Mrs. E and her husband separated before the child was born. The question arose as to who the legal mother of the child was - Mrs. E, who gave birth to the child, or E, who provided the egg."",""ratio"":""The court held that the legal mother of a child is the woman who gives birth to the child, not the woman who provides the egg. This decision was based on the principle of gestational parenthood, which gives primacy to the woman who carries the child and gives birth to it."",""decision"":""The court ruled in favor of Mrs. E, holding that she was the legal mother of the child. This decision has since been followed in other cases involving surrogacy and assisted reproduction.""}","facts: Eve was a 24 year-old mentally disabled woman living in PEI with a condition that made it very difficult for her to communicate with others.  She was sent away from her mother, who cared for her, during the week so that she could attend a special school.  Her mother was seeking the court's permission to perform a sterilization procedure (hysterectomy) on her daughter.  There was considerable evidence that the daughter would be incapable of handling the burdens of motherhood.  Eve had struck up a friendship with a boy from school, and discussed marriage, and her mother is afraid of the burden that would be placed on Eve, and ultimately upon herself to look after a child if pregnancy ensued.  Permission was denied at trial, but granted at the Court of Appeal.
issue: Can a caregiver for someone incapable of giving informed consent make decisions about surgeries for the incapable individual?
decision: Appeal allowed.
reasons: La Forest, writing for a unanimous court, discusses the history of
parens patriae
jurisdiction, which states that the state is responsible for decisions concerning those that cannot give informed consent themselves. He says that the test is generally that the only procedures that will be allowed are ones that are in the ""best interests"" of the protected person. He focuses his criticism in this case on the fact that Mrs. E. is claiming that the burden on her to look after the child should be considered in making the decision. La Forest states that this should be given no consideration, as it is only the best interests of the protected person that are of concern.
He also says that arguing about the protected person's fitness as a parents involves value-loaded questions that result in a designation of disabled persons as less competent parents, even though there is significant evidence showing that they show as much fondness and concern for their children as anyone else. He also considers that the procedure of a hysterectomy is serious surgery and quite invasive, and further that Eve does not require assistance caring for her reproductive cycle, which is a concern in other cases. Perhaps most importantly, this surgery is not therapeutic.
La Forest concludes that ""the grave intrusion on a person’s rights and the certain physical damage that ensues from non-therapeutic sterilization without consent, when compared to the highly questionable advantages that can result, [show that] it can never safely be determined that such a procedure is for the benefit of the person."" The procedure should never be authorized for non-therapeutic purposes under the
parens patriae
jurisdiction.
ratio: Non-therapeutic surgeries can never be determined to be for the benefit of a person who is incapable of giving informed consent.
It is only the best interests of the disabled person concerned that are of importance; concerns of others should not be considered."

The father had sole interim custody after separation but then the parties entered into an informal shared custody arrangement where neither party paid support.  Three years later the mother brought an action in Alberta for retroactive and ongoing support.  The chambers judge awarded her prospective support but not retroactive.  The Court of Appeal allowed her appeal, but found no blameworthy conduct or willful failure to disclose on the part of the father.
Three children were born in the course of a common law relationship. After separation the children lived with the mother, and some months later the father paid $150 in child support pursuant to a maintenance agreement which was increased to $300/month following a consent order.  The mother brought an action for retroactive support.  The father had low income and high access costs and resisted the action.  The chambers judge held retroactive support would constitute hardship.
Parents married in 1984 and divorced in 1991. After separation the two children lived with their mother and a divorce judgment ordered the father to pay $700/month in child support.  In 2000 the mother signaled an intention to request increased support.  The father voluntarily increased his payments, but still below the table amount.  The mother was unaware that his income had increased dramatically as they lived in different cities.  At chambers, the judge granted her application for retroactive support based on the table amount, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal in a 2-1 judgment.
Parents divorced in 1996.  The children lived with the father, then one of the children moved to lived with the mother.  The father had a lot more income and the mother asked for an increase of support but the father rejected the request.  The mother was hesitant to take the case to court because earlier proceedings had caused a rift between the mother and children.  The chambers judge held that this was an appropriate circumstance for a retroactive award, and he calculated it from January 1, 2003 onward, to be paid in the amount of $500/month, as a ""reasonable compromise"" that best fit the situation of the parties.  The Court of Appeal upheld the decision.
All of these proceedings were merged before the Supreme Court.
issue: Who is entitled to retroactive child support?
decision: The appeals in
DBS
and
TAR
should be allowed and the decisions of the chambers judges restored.  The appeals in
Henry
and
Hiemstra
should be dismissed.
reasons: Justice Bastarache, writing for the majority, held that children are entitled to child support from both parents commensurate with their income.  To prevent liability for retroactive support, any changes in income should be reported to the custodial parent.  If this is not done and an application is brought to enforce a change, four factors should be analysed to see if retroactive support is warranted:
Undue delay: does the recipient have a reasonable excuse for not seeking support earlier?
Any voluntary, intentional choice not to apply for an increase will militate against retroactive support.  There is a balancing here; a child should not be punished for a poor choice of the parent.
Was there blameworthy conduct on the part of the payor?
This is interpreted broadly; anything that privileges the payor's interests over his/her children's right to an appropriate amount of support.
Could the payor have reasonably believed that they were discharging their support obligations?
The more significant a change in income, the more likely a court will find a payor's behaviour blameworthy if they do not proactively disclose.
Need of child/benefit: would the child benefit from retroactive award based on their needs/circumstances?
If a child's needs are being met by the current support, this will militate against a retroactive award.
Would a retroactive award cause hardship to payor?
This is a distinct element from the
s. 10
undue hardship test.
Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.

Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.
Turning to how far back retroactive payments should go, it turns on the conduct of the parents.  If there was no blameworthy behaviour, the retroactivity should go to when the custodial parent informs the payor that they are seeking additional support.  Generally there will be a limit of 3 years.  For blameworthy parents, the retroactivity should continue to when the support should have changed and did not, without limit.
As to the amount of a retroactive payment, the court should follow the
Guidelines
, but the court has broad discretion to craft a remedy that would be fair having regard to all the circumstances, including hardship on the payor.
Applying this to the cases...
This was an initial application for child support.  The parents had a shared custody arrangement that thought that meant no child support was payable (see
Contino v Leonelli-Contino
).  The incomes of the parents were relatively equal and due to the shared custody any money going to one household would simply be removed from the other.  Due to the lack of blameworthy conduct and the lack of benefit to the children, no retroactive support was awarded.
The father from whom support was being sought was low income (~$23,000/year) and he was supporting a second family.  Any retroactive award would cause his household hardship.  The access costs for him were also high.  Because of the lack of blameworthy conduct, the hardship a retroactive award would cause, and the fact that the standard of living in the custodial household was higher, no retroactive support was awarded.
In this case, the mother had broached the subject with the father but could not afford a lawyer to fight the case.  She was intimidated by her ex-husband and did not know much about his financial situation as he lived in another city.  The husband had had a huge income increase and held it from her, as well as saying that she should have managed her money better to better provide for their kids and that he was paying all he could afford.  Due to the large amount of blameworthy conduct and the large discrepancy in the amount he was paying and the table amount, the court awarded $100,000 in retroactive support.
As in
Henry
, the parties had very different incomes; the father earned more than $100,000K/year, much more than the mother, and he gave no financial support when the need arose.  The mother said she had not wanted to litigate because of the effect it had had on her daughter the last time they litigated.  The court held that the delay of mother was not unreasonable, and the father had no reasonable grounds on which to believe the level of support he was paying was reasonable, and thus the award granted at trial was upheld.
Abella, dissenting in part, had three issues with the decision of Bastarache.
The presumptive starting date of effective notice: the payor has the information on when their income changes, so it is impractical and unrealistic to expect the recipient to keep tabs on the payor’s income; the date should be when the income changes.
The role of blameworthy conduct: the conduct of the payor should be immaterial; the whole obligation depends on the income increase, conduct of the parties is irrelevant.
The three year cutoff: Abella finds this arbitrary - any cutoff of this type should be found in statute, not created by the courts.
ratio: Retroactive child support orders should no longer be rare or difficult to obtain.
Established the framework for assessing claims where there is a large, undisclosed swing in income.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?
Children are entitled to support from both parents commensurate with their ability to pay.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?
This case is sometimes referred to as the ""don't-ask-don't-tell"" case, as the
Federal Child Support Guidelines
do not require payors to update their income information each year, merely that the paying parent make disclosure at least once a year upon request of recipient parent (
s. 25
)."

Highway Traffic Act
(now
s. 188
) which prohibited driving ""on a highway without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway"". The defendant challenged the law, claiming that it was beyond the power of the province because the federal government had ""occupied the field"" with a similar criminal provision in ss. 191/221 (now
s. 219
) of the
Criminal Code
, which prohibited driving with ""wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons"".  O'Grady was convicted at trial and an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba was dismissed.
issue: Are provincial laws relating to negligence with penal consequences criminal law and therefore
ultra vires
the province?
decision: Appeal dismissed.
reasons: Judson, writing for the majority, held that ""the power of a provincial legislature to enact legislation for the regulation of highway traffic is undoubted"".  He reaffirmed the principle that there exists a ""general area"" or ""domain"" of criminal law and the two governments can make law on the same matter by creating a distinction between the types of culpability.  He quotes from Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law:
There are only two states of mind which constitute
mens rea
, and they are intention and recklessness. The difference between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; they are opposed and it is a logical fallacy to suggest that recklessness is a degree of negligence. The common habit of lawyers to qualify the word ""negligence"" with some moral epithet such as ""wicked"", ""gross"", or ""culpable"" has been most unfortunate since it has inevitably led to great confusion of thought and of principle. It is equally misleading to speak of criminal negligence since this is merely to use an expression to explain itself.
On the facts, Judson found that there was overlap between the laws however ""there is no conflict between these provisions in the sense that they are repugnant"". The provincial law extended to include ""inadvertent negligence"" as well as regular negligence. It was enough that “the two pieces of legislation differed both in legislative purpose and legal and practical effect” to justify both of them.
ratio: The distinction between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; recklessness is when an actor does not desire harmful consequences but forsees the possibility and consciously takes the risk.
There must be an operational incompatibility between federal and provincial law to invoke paramountcy."

He makes a claim to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, but refuses to argue sexual orientation as a ground, and instead will only argue family status, stating that all matters to do with homosexuals are not about sexual orientation by definition.  The case was dismissed in the lower courts.
issue: Can a homosexual man claim discrimination against ""family status"" with his partner under
s.3 of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
?
decision: Appeal dismissed..
reasons: The court is upset with the appellant who refused to deal with the claim on the ground of sexual orientation, which was new at the time.  However, Mossop sticks with family status.  The majority says that you cannot interpret ""family status"" to include Mossop’s situation unless you also discuss the ground of sexual orientation, and as Mossop refuses to do so he cannot be successful.
La Forest
concurs, but instead looks to the definitions in the Act and tries to figure out what the government meant to protect under ""family status"".  He determines that this specific field was not intended to be covered.
In the dissent,
L'Heureux-Dubé
says that ""family status"" should have a very broad interpretation.  She looks to the broader social context of limiting it as the majority does, and further that by looking at the plain meaning given in the statute you are really just taking the majority's opinion of the definition, which is exactly what you try to avoid in human rights issues.  She also suggests that when there are overlapping grounds, you should select the one that will succeed and proceed with that one.

This was upheld by the British Columbia Supreme Court but overruled by the Court of Appeal.
issue: Does an absolute prohibition on licensing people with a visual impairment without the possibility of individual assessment constitute discrimination?
decision: Appeal allowed, standard disallowed.
reasons: The court applies the
Meiorin
test, showing that it can be used in scenarios outside of the workplace to determine if discrimination is justified.  This case passes the first part because the purpose of the standard (reasonable safety) is rationally connected to the function (issuing drivers’ licenses).  It also passes the second step because there is no evidence that the standard (no licenses for HH sufferers) was adopted for any reasons other than road safety.  However the case fails the third step as the court finds that the standard (no licenses for HH) is not reasonably necessary for the purpose (reasonable safety).  The blanket prohibition doesn't let people even attempt to show that they can drive safely.
It is clear here that the accommodation would be to allow testing.  In order to succeed the government would have had to prove that to allow testing would result to undue hardship which they failed to do.  Although there are clearly safety and cost concerns involved with testing, the government didn't put in any effort to determine these values, nor did they even look for alternative ways of testing.  The court also says that in general, with the government, costs must be exorbitant to amount to undue hardship, as they are publicly funded and this would be seen as being in the public interest.  As the standard is not rationally necessary for the purpose of reasonable road safety, it amounts to discrimination and must be removed.
ratio: The
Meiorin
test applies to all standards that are thought to be discriminatory, even if they do not occur in a workplace; called bona fide justification tests.
The government will be held to a very high threshold when claiming that the costs of not adopting a standard amount to undue hardship as they are publicly funded and preventing discrimination is in the public interest."
MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,Just v British Columbia,"{""facts"":""The case concerned the rights of Just, a person with disabilities, to access health services without discrimination. Just had been denied access to a medical clinic due to his physical disability. The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal found that the clinic had discriminated against Just, but the decision was overturned by the British Columbia Supreme Court."",""ratio"":""The Supreme Court of Canada held that the denial of access to medical services based on a person's disability is a form of discrimination under the British Columbia Human Rights Code. The court also held that the duty to accommodate persons with disabilities is a fundamental principle of human rights law, and that service providers must make reasonable efforts to accommodate the needs of persons with disabilities."",""decision"":""The Supreme Court of Canada restored the decision of the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal, finding that the clinic had discriminated against Just and ordering the clinic to make reasonable efforts to accommodate his needs in the future.""}","facts: Heavy snow fall forced Just and his daughter to stop in a line of traffic by a rocky slope on a major highway.  A boulder, which worked loose from the wooded slopes above the highway, came crashing down on the appellant's car, killing the appellant's daughter and causing him very serious injuries.  Just brought an action against the provincial government contending that the government negligently failed to properly maintain the highway.
The Department of Highways had set up a system for inspection and remedial work upon rock slopes.  Inspection and recommendations were made by engineers and the work was effected by a rock scaling crew responsible for performing remedial work throughout the entire province.  The department's practice had been to make visual inspections from the highway unless rock falls or a history of instability in an area indicated a need for the rock engineer to climb the slope.  Numerous informal inspections were carried out by highway personnel as they drove along the road.
The trial judge found that the entire system of inspection and the way it was implemented was a policy matter which did not give rise to liability. No finding was made as to whether or not the system of inspection was reasonable or whether the inspections themselves were properly carried out. The Court of Appeal upheld the finding of the trial judge and Just appealled to the Supreme Court.
issue: Is the government under a duty of care to maintain the highways and if so, are they liable if the highways are not sufficiently maintained?
decision: Appeal allowed, new trial ordered.
reasons: Cory, writing for the majority, held that the province owes a duty of care, which ordinarily extends to their reasonable maintenance, to those using its highways.  The Department of Highways could readily foresee the risk that harm might befall users of a highway if it were not reasonably maintained.  That maintenance could be found to extend to the prevention of injury from falling rock.
Government agencies may be exempt from the application of the traditional tort law duty of care if an explicit statutory exemption exists or if the decision arose as a result of a policy decision.  Whether or not a decision is characterized as a policy decision or as an operational decision rests on the nature of the decision and not on the identity of the actors.  Generally, decisions concerning budgetary allotments for departments or government agencies should be classified as policy decisions.  A policy decision may be open to challenge on the basis that it is not made in the bona fide exercise of discretion.  If after due consideration it is found that a duty of care is owed by the government agency and no exemption by way of statute or policy decision-making is found to exist, a traditional torts analysis ensues (as per
Anns v Merton London Borough Council
) and the issue of standard of care required of the government agency must next be considered.  The manner and quality of an inspection system, since it was clearly part of the operational aspect of a governmental activity, should be assessed when consideration is given to the standard of care issue.  At this stage, the requisite standard of care must be assessed in light of all the surrounding circumstances including budgetary restraints and the availability of qualified personnel and equipment.
Sopinka, in the dissent, held that the government had the power to carry out the inspections but was under no duty to do so.  Conduct within the limits of this discretion gives rise to no duty of care; conduct outside of these limits may attract a private law duty of care.
A litigant may not attack a policy and it is not appropriate for a Court to pass on it, absent evidence that a policy was adopted for some ulterior motive and not for a municipal purpose.  In order for a private duty to arise, it would have to be shown that the Rockwork Section acted outside its delegated discretion to determine whether to inspect and the manner in which the inspection is to be made.  Policy decisions are immune from review because they usually entail not only a decision to do something but also some call upon the public purse.  The government was acting within its discretion when it decided that inspections should be done and the manner in which they were to be done.  Responsibility for deciding the extent to which the inspection program was to be implemented was delegated to the Rockwork Section.
ratio: The duty of care should apply to a public authority unless there is a valid basis for its exclusion.
Policy decisions – the decision by the government about what acts to perform under a given statute – are exempt from liability; operational decisions – the decision by the government about how to perform those acts once they have been decided - are not exempt from liability."

However, when HOJ terminated Machtinger's employment, they provided him with only two weeks' notice and no pay in lieu thereof. Machtinger sued for wrongful dismissal, arguing that the termination clause was unenforceable because it did not comply with the minimum notice requirements set out in the Employment Standards Act"",""ratio"":""The Supreme Court of Canada held that employment contracts are to be interpreted in a manner that encourages employers to comply with the minimum notice requirements set out in employment standards legislation.

The Court awarded Machtinger damages for wrongful dismissal in the amount of six months' salary, reflecting the reasonable notice period to which he was entitled.""}","facts: Both appellants began working for HOJ Industries, a car dealer, in 1978, and were discharged in 1985 without cause.  At the time they were dismissed Machtinger was credit manager and rust‑proofing sales manager and Lefebvre was sales manager.  Each had entered into a contract for employment for an indefinite period which contained a clause allowing the respondent to terminate his employment without cause, in Machtinger's case without notice and in Lefebvre's case on two weeks' notice.  Under the provincial
Employment Standards Act
the appellants were entitled to a minimum notice period of four weeks.  After they were dismissed, the respondent paid each of them the equivalent of four weeks' salary.  The appellants brought action for wrongful dismissal and the trial judge found that they were entitled to reasonable notice of termination, and that the period of reasonable notice for Machtinger was 7 months and for Lefebvre, 7½ months, however this was overturned by the Court of Appeal.
issue: What should the notice period be in order to terminate employment if notice required in employment contract violates legislated standards?
decision: Appeal allowed, lower court judgment restored.
reasons: McLachlin, writing a concurring judgment, examined the legal principles governing the implication of terms.  She identifies three types of implied terms:
terms implied by fact (intention required);
terms implied by law (no intention required); and
terms implied by custom and usage,
and identifies #2 as the type the courts will read into a contract.  Implication of law can be from custom, for business efficiency (what is necessary in a contract), or what is reasonable (from Denning's dissent in
Liverpool City Council v Irwin
).
She finds that the Court of Appeal erred in characterizing a term implied in law as a term implied in fact, which brought in the intentionality of the parties.  Holding that the employer had a legal obligation to provide reasonable notice and that this can only be displaced by an express contrary agreement, the court imposed a reasonable term of notification on HOJ; HOJ industries.
ratio: Terms can be implied by the court based on:
custom or usage;
if necessary for business efficacy;
legal incidents of a particular class of contract."
MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,Homex Realty and Development Co. Ltd. v Wyoming (Village),"{""facts"":""The case involved a dispute between Homex Realty and Development Co. Ltd. (Homex) and the Village of Wyoming (Wyoming) regarding a development project. Homex had entered into an agreement with Wyoming to develop a parcel of land, but the project was not completed due to financial difficulties. Homex subsequently sought a refund of the deposit it had paid to Wyoming, but Wyoming refused, citing a clause in the agreement that allowed it to retain the deposit in the event of Homex's default."",""ratio"":""The court held that the clause allowing Wyoming to retain the deposit was unenforceable because it was a penalty clause, which is contrary to public policy. The court also found that Homex had not defaulted on the agreement, as the non-completion of the project was due to circumstances beyond its control."",""decision"":""The court ordered Wyoming to refund the deposit to Homex, along with interest and costs.""}","facts: As a condition of registration of a plan of subdivision in the Village of Wyoming, Atkinson, the owner and subdivider of the parcel of land, entered into an agreement with the Village for the installation of municipal services in the subdivision. This agreement, dated January 22, 1968, and registered September 26, 1975, provided in a general way for the owner's providing ""all the requirements financial and otherwise, of the Corporation re surfacing of roads, installation of services and drainage"". The agreement also prevented the sale of the lands in question until the agreement had been fully carried out, except with the consent of the Village, but the provision did not provide that consent would operate to release Atkinson from his obligation to the Village. Before any services were installed, Homex bought the great majority of the lots on the subdivision with the Village's consent. There was some question as to whether or not Homex had undertaken to assume the obligations of the original subdivider. Nevertheless, when protracted negotiations between the Village and Homex concerning the installation of services proved fruitless, the Village, in April 1976, pursuant to s. 29(3) (now
s. 50(3)
) of the
Planning Act
and without notice to Homex, enacted by-law 7 deeming the lots purchased by Homex not to be a registered plan of subdivision. Homex, in September 1976, made application for judicial review for an order quashing by-law 7 and, while the application was pending, checkerboarded its lots.
In November 1975, Homex and the Village negotiated the installation of services along the only street requiring them. By-law 6, enacted in December 1975, provided that it was the policy of the Village that it would neither assume responsibility for a water pipeline constructed by Homex nor permit its connection to the municipal water supply system. Homex coupled an application in judicial review to quash by-law 6 with the application for an order to quash by-law 7.
issue: What qualifies as a ""legislative"" decision such that no duty of procedural fairness applies?
decision: Appeal dismissed.
reasons: Estey, writing for the majority, held that while the passage of By-law 7 had some characteristics of a community interest, it was also clearly the culmination of the dispute between the village and Homex.  As a result he found that the decision was quasi-judicial such as to attract the principle of notice and the doctrine of
audi alteram partem
.  Despite this, however, he held that the conduct of Homex to rid itself of the obligations under the agreement with Atkinson were such that it should be denied a discretionary remedy.  There was also no basis to challenge By-law 6 as it simply stated the facts of the agreement with Atkinson.
Dickson, in the dissent, is quoted:
The courts long ago developed the general proposition that wherever a statute authorizes the interference with property or other rights and is silent as to whether or not the agency in question is required to give notice prior to the intervention in such rights, the courts will ""supply the omission of the legislature"" and require the agency in question to afford the subject an opportunity of being heard before it proceeds.
He held that an act could not be labelled ""legislative"" merely for the purpose of dispensing with fairness. It was not particularly important that the function of the municipality was classified as ""legislative"" or ""quasi-judicial"", rather, it was necessary to look at the nature of the function and to the facts of each case. The by-law in question was not of wide and general application, but was rather aimed at deliberately limiting the rights of Homex, entitling it to some procedural safeguards - at a minimum, notice of the proposed by-law and the opportunity to be heard.
ratio: In general, the courts have not imposed procedural requirements on the subordinate law-making function.
The facts of each case are key to determining the level of procedural fairness required."

Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada v Bell Canada
.  On appeal Bell is arguing that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal process is unfair because the Canadian Human Rights Commission makes regulations that the Tribunal must follow, and then appears in front of them seeking favorable decisions.  They claim that this constitutes a conflict of interest and a lack of necessary ""judicial"" independence.
issue: Does the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal lack independence and impartiality because of the power of the Canadian Human Rights Commission to issue binding guidelines for them before they appear in front of them?
decision: Appeal dismissed, case to proceed to Tribunal.
reasons: The court recognizes that Bell's claims are not without merit, however after consideration they dismiss them.  The court held that Bell did not provide sufficient evidence for their claims and also because they misunderstand impartiality - it does not mean having the freedom to decide a case however one wishes to, being subject to certain binding principles is perfectly legitimate for an impartial judiciary.  Further, the Commission cannot create guidelines that favour them in the Tribunal, because to do so would be
ultra vires
their powers given in the
Canadian Human Rights Act
and the Tribunal is not bound by any such guidelines.  The powers that the Commission has to enact guidelines under
s.27(2)
and
s.27(3)
of the
Act
are constrained as all powers to create subordinate legislation are, and therefore the system is not flawed.

MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,Catholic Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto v CM,"{""facts"":""The case involved a child who was born with a severe disability requiring 24-hour care and was placed in the care of the Catholic Children's Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto. The Society applied for a declaration that the child was in need of protection and for an order placing the child in the care of the Society permanently. The child's parents opposed the application, arguing that they were capable of caring for the child with the help of community resources."",""ratio"":""The court held that a child is in need of protection if the child's physical, emotional, or psychological well-being is in danger due to the actions or inactions of the parents.

The court placed the child in the care of the Society permanently and granted the Society custody and guardianship of the child.""}","facts: The aid society took SM into protection on several occasions and supervised her mother, CM, on parenting skills. On consent, SM was made a ward of the society 1989. Throughout the wardship, the society continued to work with CM and facilitated regular visits with SM, however, bonding between mother and daughter remained minimal. In December 1989, after a second four-month wardship, the society brought a status review application seeking an order of Crown wardship without access for the purposes of adoption. CM opposed the motion and the matter was dealt with sporadically throughout 1991. In February 1992 the Ontario Provincial Court ordered that SM be returned to CM on the basis that court intervention was no longer necessary to protect the child. The judge considered CM capable of acquiring the skill to care for her daughter adequately. The society obtained a stay of the order and unsuccessfully appealed to the Ontario Court (General Division). The Court of Appeal granted a stay of the order for return pending appeal and a motion for the introduction of fresh evidence. The new evidence concerned the consistent and repeated assertions of the child that she regarded her foster family as her real family, that she did not want to see her birth mother and that attempts to implement access visits with CM had become almost impossible because of the child's negative reactions - emotional, psychological and physical.  It allowed the appeal, set aside the order for the return of the child to the mother and ordered that the child be made a Crown ward without access for the purposes of adoption. CM appealed to the Supreme Court.
issue: Does the child need continued protection?
decision: Appeal dismissed.
reasons: L'Heureux-Dubé, writing for the court, reviewed the case law and determined that when a court is determining whether the wardship should be terminated or continue, the judge should not determine whether an order of wardship should have been made in the previous or earlier hearings, but instead
now
consider whether continuation of the wardship in the current proceedings is in the best interests of the child without overlooking the parents' rights.  The review hearing is not about retrying the original need for a protection order, but rather the court should determine the circumstances of the parents or parent since the last order as it relates to the situation with respect to the child's custody, including their physical, mental and emotional state since that time and also whether there is now a lifestyle, including attitudes of the parent, that warrants the child being returned to the parent or to wardship.
She lays out a two part test:
Does the child continue to need protection and require a court order for protection?
The children's aid society must continue to justify its intervention by showing that a court order is necessary to protect the child in the future.  This does not mean that an absence of proof of a deficiency in the parent's parenting capacity is enough to return the child to the parent.  A court order may be necessary to protect the child from emotional harm which would result in future if the child were taken from its psychological parents.
What is in the best interests of the children?
This should be decided through a balancing of the considerations such as the importance of the continuity of care, the child’s physical/emotional/psychological needs, the benefit of a child's bond to his/her biological parent, as well as psychological bonding of child to his/her foster family.
The furtherance and protection of the child’s best interests must take priority over the desires and interests of the parent.
The question is not merely whether the parent has seen the light and is now prepared to be a good parent, but whether or not the parent has, in factk turned a new leaf and whether he or she is now able to give to the children the care they require?

It commenced proceedings for negligent misrepresentation against the engineering firm which prepared those drawings, N.D.

issue: Is the defendent exempt from liability due to the intervention of the Ministry and their liability clause?
decision: Appeal allowed.

makes a representation,
knows it will be relied upon, and
it is relied upon.
When Edgeworth performed the construction it was relying on N.D. Lea, not the provincial government.  Following the provisions in
London Drugs
the court finds there was no express or implied protection of the respondent in the contract.  Further, unlike in

They operated a resort lodge in Algonquin Park in the summer and lived in Toronto in the winter. Both parties worked in the business; the husband handled the finance and the wife the day-to-day operation of the lodge. When they separated in 1993, both parties were in their early 40s and all the children were under 8 years old. The wife wanted to stay home with the children given their ages. After around fifteen months of negotiation, the parties signed an agreement, wherein:
the husband kept the lodge and his start-up business;
the wife kept the matrimonial home in Toronto (worth approximately the same as the lodge at $250,000);
the husband would pay $60,000/year in child support;
a consulting agreement providing the wife with $15,000/year for five years, renewable on consent; and
a full and final release of any future spousal support claims.
After the divorce judgment was issued in 1997, the wife's childcare obligations changed and the consulting agreement was not renewed. She applied to the court for relief, including spousal support. The trial judge referred to the husband as ""manipulative"" and ""obsessive"". The application was allowed, child support was brought in line with the
Guidelines
and the wife was awarded support of $4,400/month for five years. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment regarding spousal support, and the husband was given leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.
issue: When should a support agreement be upheld by the courts?
decision: Appeal allowed; original support order stands.
reasons: Arbour and Bastarache, writing for the majority, stress finality and certainty as key principles in support agreements, citing
s. 9 of the
Divorce Act
; these are contracts and as long as they were entered into openly, the courts should enforce them.
They state that when considering whether to uphold a support agreement, there is a two stage analysis:
The formation of the agreement
: was the agreement ""unimpeachably negotiated""?
Factors to consider:
representation by counsel: the degree of professional assistance received by the party is relevant, but a court should not presume an imbalance of power.
circumstances: was one or both parties vulnerable and if so, did presence of counsel rectify this vulnerability?
duration of negotiations: was the agreement negotiated over a reasonable amount of time?
Substance of the agreement: does the agreement remain in substantial compliance with the objectives of the
Divorce Act
?
The analysis should not be restricted to the spousal support component – look at the whole agreement; the agreement as a whole should substantially comply with the factors and objectives of the
Act
(including the principles of certainty, autonomy and finality).
An agreement can be modified to bring it in line with the principles in the
Act
.
Agreement's correspondence to the parties' original intentions
: were the current circumstances anticipated when the agreement was drafted?
Foreseeability is interpreted broadly; circumstances do not have to have been explicitly considered/contemplated
Foreseeable circumstances include a change of job, assets going down in value, etc.

Generally, where negotiation of the agreement was correct and the agreement remains in substantial compliance with the
Act
, the court should defer to the wishes of the party and accord the agreement great weight.
Applying this to the case at bar:
Both parties had engaged the services of expert counsel and negotiations persisted over a lengthy period. Although the husband may have been the dominant party, the wife had adequate counsel; there was no hint of any vulnerabilities that might not be compensated by counsel.
The quantum of child support established in the agreement intended to provide the wife with a minimum amount of income in contemplation of her not working. While the wife argues that the business generates income, this was accounted for when the assets were valued and divided. The consulting contract reflects the parties' intention to provide the wife with a source of employment income for a limited time. The wife chose not to go back to the workforce, and had substantial assets even without support; there was no hardship or long-term disadvantage.
In the result, the original order should stand.
LeBel and Deschamps, in the dissent, stress very different concepts: interdependence and unequal bargaining power.  They propose a simpler test; is the agreement objectively unfair when considered now?
The dissenters disagree with the majority in two key areas.  One, the presence of counsel may not be enough to negate a power imbalance, and two, that very little deference should be given to agreements that deviate from the objectives in
s. 15.2(6)
of the
Act
; any fair agreement should reasonably realize the four stated objectives.
ratio: Establishes the test for enforcement of support agreements.
Miglin
applies only to final spousal support agreements.  A final agreement is one which limits the amount or duration of support or waives support entirely; it does not contemplate variation."
MISTRAL.open-mixtral-8x22b,Dobson v Dobson,"{""facts"":""In this case, the testator, George Dobson, made a will in 1930 leaving his estate to his wife and, if she predeceased him, to his brother. The will also contained a clause that his wife could use and occupy any real estate during her lifetime. The testator then married his wife, but no children were born during the marriage.

While in the 27th week of pregnancy she was driving her car when her negligent actions caused a car accident.  The fetus was permanently injured, and was born prematurely that day.  Her son, Ryan Dobson, suffered physical and mental injuries, including cerebral palsy.  His grandfather launched a tort claim for damages against his mother.  Ryan was successful at the Court of Appeal, which his mother appealed.
issue: Should a mother be liable in tort for damages to her child arising from a prenatal negligent act that allegedly injured the fetus in her womb?
decision: Appeal allowed.
reasons: Cory, writing for the majority, finds that the mother should not be held liable in the situation because of the policy implications.  They employ the
Kamloops
test to determine if a duty of care should be owed.  It has two parts:
Is the relationship between the two parties close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there any public policy implications that should negate or limit the scope of the duty?
They find that the first part is satisfied; however the public policy implications negate the duty.  They state that there are two main reasons for this: it would violate the privacy and autonomy of women, and it is impossible to judicially define a reasonable standard of conduct for pregnant women.
McLachlin, in a concurring judgment, states that another main reason why this duty cannot be imposed is that it would violate pregnant women's rights under the
Charter
– specifically liberty and equality.  They would lose their liberty, and not be treated equally with other women in society.
Major, in the dissent, states that in order for the public policy implications to negate the duty they must add new restrictions on what the woman can do.  He says that this is not the case, because she had a duty of care to everyone else on the road, and extending that to the foetus would not change the reasonable standard of her conduct.  He says that this case deals specifically with pregnant women driving automobiles, and if the creation of duty imposed a limitation on her actions that was not there previously then the outcome would be different.  He uses the example with another pregnant woman in the car – if the same outcome occurred, then there is no question that the other woman's foetus could sue her for negligence.  He agrees that the
Kamloops
test applies, but says that the policy implications here do not negate the duty.
ratio: Pregnant women do not owe a duty of care to the foetus in their womb.
The test to determine if a duty of care is owed has two parts:

GROQ.Gemma 2 9B,Calder et al. v British Columbia (Attorney General),"{""facts"":""Calder et al. are police officers who were part of the BC Police Department's Major Crime Unit. The province of BC instituted a policy that required police officers to complete an administrative review process for any incident involving the discharge of a firearm. This process included identifying all witnesses and reviewing police video and audio recordings. Two of the officers, Calder and MacLean, were part of a group that conducted a traffic stop which resulted in a fatal shooting. They were both investigated under the policy. Calder and MacLean refused to participate in the administrative review process and were subsequently disciplined under the BC Police Act, which allows for disciplinary action against officers who fail to comply with lawful directives.

issue: Do the alleged aboriginal land claims exist?
If the claims exist, were they extinguished?

reasons: At trial and upon initial appeal the courts decided that if there ever was aboriginal title, it was surely extinguished upon confederation.  The Supreme Court holds that aboriginal title definitely exists, however they were split over whether or not it had been extinguished.  The majority decided that it has been extinguished by virtue of the government's exercise of control over the lands, and therefore the appeal is dismissed.  However, the dissenting judges disagree and state that more must be present to prove that the lands were extinguished.  They say that the provincial government did not have any constitutional right to deal with the land of the aboriginals, and that their predecessors before confederation did not do anything that could amount to extinguishing the lands.

She was sent away from her mother, who cared for her, during the week so that she could attend a special school.  Her mother was seeking the court's permission to perform a sterilization procedure (hysterectomy) on her daughter.  There was considerable evidence that the daughter would be incapable of handling the burdens of motherhood.  Eve had struck up a friendship with a boy from school, and discussed marriage, and her mother is afraid of the burden that would be placed on Eve, and ultimately upon herself to look after a child if pregnancy ensued.  Permission was denied at trial, but granted at the Court of Appeal.
issue: Can a caregiver for someone incapable of giving informed consent make decisions about surgeries for the incapable individual?
decision: Appeal allowed.
reasons: La Forest, writing for a unanimous court, discusses the history of
parens patriae
jurisdiction, which states that the state is responsible for decisions concerning those that cannot give informed consent themselves. He says that the test is generally that the only procedures that will be allowed are ones that are in the ""best interests"" of the protected person. He focuses his criticism in this case on the fact that Mrs. E. is claiming that the burden on her to look after the child should be considered in making the decision. La Forest states that this should be given no consideration, as it is only the best interests of the protected person that are of concern.
He also says that arguing about the protected person's fitness as a parents involves value-loaded questions that result in a designation of disabled persons as less competent parents, even though there is significant evidence showing that they show as much fondness and concern for their children as anyone else. He also considers that the procedure of a hysterectomy is serious surgery and quite invasive, and further that Eve does not require assistance caring for her reproductive cycle, which is a concern in other cases. Perhaps most importantly, this surgery is not therapeutic.
La Forest concludes that ""the grave intrusion on a person’s rights and the certain physical damage that ensues from non-therapeutic sterilization without consent, when compared to the highly questionable advantages that can result, [show that] it can never safely be determined that such a procedure is for the benefit of the person."" The procedure should never be authorized for non-therapeutic purposes under the

The father had sole interim custody after separation but then the parties entered into an informal shared custody arrangement where neither party paid support.  Three years later the mother brought an action in Alberta for retroactive and ongoing support.  The chambers judge awarded her prospective support but not retroactive.  The Court of Appeal allowed her appeal, but found no blameworthy conduct or willful failure to disclose on the part of the father.
Three children were born in the course of a common law relationship. After separation the children lived with the mother, and some months later the father paid $150 in child support pursuant to a maintenance agreement which was increased to $300/month following a consent order.  The mother brought an action for retroactive support.  The father had low income and high access costs and resisted the action.  The chambers judge held retroactive support would constitute hardship.
Parents married in 1984 and divorced in 1991. After separation the two children lived with their mother and a divorce judgment ordered the father to pay $700/month in child support.  In 2000 the mother signaled an intention to request increased support.  The father voluntarily increased his payments, but still below the table amount.  The mother was unaware that his income had increased dramatically as they lived in different cities.  At chambers, the judge granted her application for retroactive support based on the table amount, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal in a 2-1 judgment.
Parents divorced in 1996.  The children lived with the father, then one of the children moved to lived with the mother.  The father had a lot more income and the mother asked for an increase of support but the father rejected the request.  The mother was hesitant to take the case to court because earlier proceedings had caused a rift between the mother and children.  The chambers judge held that this was an appropriate circumstance for a retroactive award, and he calculated it from January 1, 2003 onward, to be paid in the amount of $500/month, as a ""reasonable compromise"" that best fit the situation of the parties.  The Court of Appeal upheld the decision.
All of these proceedings were merged before the Supreme Court.
issue: Who is entitled to retroactive child support?
decision: The appeals in
DBS
and
TAR
should be allowed and the decisions of the chambers judges restored.  The appeals in
Henry
and
Hiemstra
should be dismissed.
reasons: Justice Bastarache, writing for the majority, held that children are entitled to child support from both parents commensurate with their income.  To prevent liability for retroactive support, any changes in income should be reported to the custodial parent.  If this is not done and an application is brought to enforce a change, four factors should be analysed to see if retroactive support is warranted:
Undue delay: does the recipient have a reasonable excuse for not seeking support earlier?
Any voluntary, intentional choice not to apply for an increase will militate against retroactive support.  There is a balancing here; a child should not be punished for a poor choice of the parent.
Was there blameworthy conduct on the part of the payor?
This is interpreted broadly; anything that privileges the payor's interests over his/her children's right to an appropriate amount of support.
Could the payor have reasonably believed that they were discharging their support obligations?
The more significant a change in income, the more likely a court will find a payor's behaviour blameworthy if they do not proactively disclose.
Need of child/benefit: would the child benefit from retroactive award based on their needs/circumstances?
If a child's needs are being met by the current support, this will militate against a retroactive award.
Would a retroactive award cause hardship to payor?
This is a distinct element from the
s. 10
undue hardship test.
Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.

Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.
Turning to how far back retroactive payments should go, it turns on the conduct of the parents.  If there was no blameworthy behaviour, the retroactivity should go to when the custodial parent informs the payor that they are seeking additional support.  Generally there will be a limit of 3 years.  For blameworthy parents, the retroactivity should continue to when the support should have changed and did not, without limit.
As to the amount of a retroactive payment, the court should follow the
Guidelines
, but the court has broad discretion to craft a remedy that would be fair having regard to all the circumstances, including hardship on the payor.
Applying this to the cases...
This was an initial application for child support.  The parents had a shared custody arrangement that thought that meant no child support was payable (see
Contino v Leonelli-Contino
).  The incomes of the parents were relatively equal and due to the shared custody any money going to one household would simply be removed from the other.  Due to the lack of blameworthy conduct and the lack of benefit to the children, no retroactive support was awarded.
The father from whom support was being sought was low income (~$23,000/year) and he was supporting a second family.  Any retroactive award would cause his household hardship.  The access costs for him were also high.  Because of the lack of blameworthy conduct, the hardship a retroactive award would cause, and the fact that the standard of living in the custodial household was higher, no retroactive support was awarded.
In this case, the mother had broached the subject with the father but could not afford a lawyer to fight the case.  She was intimidated by her ex-husband and did not know much about his financial situation as he lived in another city.  The husband had had a huge income increase and held it from her, as well as saying that she should have managed her money better to better provide for their kids and that he was paying all he could afford.  Due to the large amount of blameworthy conduct and the large discrepancy in the amount he was paying and the table amount, the court awarded $100,000 in retroactive support.
As in
Henry
, the parties had very different incomes; the father earned more than $100,000K/year, much more than the mother, and he gave no financial support when the need arose.  The mother said she had not wanted to litigate because of the effect it had had on her daughter the last time they litigated.  The court held that the delay of mother was not unreasonable, and the father had no reasonable grounds on which to believe the level of support he was paying was reasonable, and thus the award granted at trial was upheld.
Abella, dissenting in part, had three issues with the decision of Bastarache.
The presumptive starting date of effective notice: the payor has the information on when their income changes, so it is impractical and unrealistic to expect the recipient to keep tabs on the payor’s income; the date should be when the income changes.
The role of blameworthy conduct: the conduct of the payor should be immaterial; the whole obligation depends on the income increase, conduct of the parties is irrelevant.
The three year cutoff: Abella finds this arbitrary - any cutoff of this type should be found in statute, not created by the courts.
ratio: Retroactive child support orders should no longer be rare or difficult to obtain.
Established the framework for assessing claims where there is a large, undisclosed swing in income.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?
Children are entitled to support from both parents commensurate with their ability to pay.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?
This case is sometimes referred to as the ""don't-ask-don't-tell"" case, as the
Federal Child Support Guidelines
do not require payors to update their income information each year, merely that the paying parent make disclosure at least once a year upon request of recipient parent (

Highway Traffic Act

) which prohibited driving ""on a highway without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the highway"". The defendant challenged the law, claiming that it was beyond the power of the province because the federal government had ""occupied the field"" with a similar criminal provision in ss. 191/221 (now
s. 219
) of the
Criminal Code
, which prohibited driving with ""wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons"".  O'Grady was convicted at trial and an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba was dismissed.
issue: Are provincial laws relating to negligence with penal consequences criminal law and therefore
ultra vires
the province?
decision: Appeal dismissed.
reasons: Judson, writing for the majority, held that ""the power of a provincial legislature to enact legislation for the regulation of highway traffic is undoubted"".  He reaffirmed the principle that there exists a ""general area"" or ""domain"" of criminal law and the two governments can make law on the same matter by creating a distinction between the types of culpability.  He quotes from Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law:
There are only two states of mind which constitute
mens rea
, and they are intention and recklessness. The difference between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; they are opposed and it is a logical fallacy to suggest that recklessness is a degree of negligence. The common habit of lawyers to qualify the word ""negligence"" with some moral epithet such as ""wicked"", ""gross"", or ""culpable"" has been most unfortunate since it has inevitably led to great confusion of thought and of principle. It is equally misleading to speak of criminal negligence since this is merely to use an expression to explain itself.
On the facts, Judson found that there was overlap between the laws however ""there is no conflict between these provisions in the sense that they are repugnant"". The provincial law extended to include ""inadvertent negligence"" as well as regular negligence. It was enough that “the two pieces of legislation differed both in legislative purpose and legal and practical effect” to justify both of them.
ratio: The distinction between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; recklessness is when an actor does not desire harmful consequences but forsees the possibility and consciously takes the risk.
There must be an operational incompatibility between federal and provincial law to invoke paramountcy."

He makes a claim to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, but refuses to argue sexual orientation as a ground, and instead will only argue family status, stating that all matters to do with homosexuals are not about sexual orientation by definition.  The case was dismissed in the lower courts.
issue: Can a homosexual man claim discrimination against ""family status"" with his partner under
s.3 of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
?
decision: Appeal dismissed..
reasons: The court is upset with the appellant who refused to deal with the claim on the ground of sexual orientation, which was new at the time.  However, Mossop sticks with family status.  The majority says that you cannot interpret ""family status"" to include Mossop’s situation unless you also discuss the ground of sexual orientation, and as Mossop refuses to do so he cannot be successful.
La Forest
concurs, but instead looks to the definitions in the Act and tries to figure out what the government meant to protect under ""family status"".  He determines that this specific field was not intended to be covered.
In the dissent,
L'Heureux-Dubé
says that ""family status"" should have a very broad interpretation.  She looks to the broader social context of limiting it as the majority does, and further that by looking at the plain meaning given in the statute you are really just taking the majority's opinion of the definition, which is exactly what you try to avoid in human rights issues.  She also suggests that when there are overlapping grounds, you should select the one that will succeed and proceed with that one.

The claimant had this condition but had driven flawlessly at work and on public roads using ""prism glasses"".  Despite this he was refused individual assessment and was not allowed to receive a license and was therefore unable to complete his job.  The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal allowed Grismer to be individually tested.  Grismer died shortly after this decision.  This was upheld by the British Columbia Supreme Court but overruled by the Court of Appeal.
issue: Does an absolute prohibition on licensing people with a visual impairment without the possibility of individual assessment constitute discrimination?
decision: Appeal allowed, standard disallowed.
reasons: The court applies the
Meiorin
test, showing that it can be used in scenarios outside of the workplace to determine if discrimination is justified.  This case passes the first part because the purpose of the standard (reasonable safety) is rationally connected to the function (issuing drivers’ licenses).  It also passes the second step because there is no evidence that the standard (no licenses for HH sufferers) was adopted for any reasons other than road safety.  However the case fails the third step as the court finds that the standard (no licenses for HH) is not reasonably necessary for the purpose (reasonable safety).  The blanket prohibition doesn't let people even attempt to show that they can drive safely.
It is clear here that the accommodation would be to allow testing.  In order to succeed the government would have had to prove that to allow testing would result to undue hardship which they failed to do.  Although there are clearly safety and cost concerns involved with testing, the government didn't put in any effort to determine these values, nor did they even look for alternative ways of testing.  The court also says that in general, with the government, costs must be exorbitant to amount to undue hardship, as they are publicly funded and this would be seen as being in the public interest.  As the standard is not rationally necessary for the purpose of reasonable road safety, it amounts to discrimination and must be removed.
ratio: The
Meiorin
test applies to all standards that are thought to be discriminatory, even if they do not occur in a workplace; called bona fide justification tests.
The government will be held to a very high threshold when claiming that the costs of not adopting a standard amount to undue hardship as they are publicly funded and preventing discrimination is in the public interest."

A boulder, which worked loose from the wooded slopes above the highway, came crashing down on the appellant's car, killing the appellant's daughter and causing him very serious injuries.  Just brought an action against the provincial government contending that the government negligently failed to properly maintain the highway.
The Department of Highways had set up a system for inspection and remedial work upon rock slopes.  Inspection and recommendations were made by engineers and the work was effected by a rock scaling crew responsible for performing remedial work throughout the entire province.  The department's practice had been to make visual inspections from the highway unless rock falls or a history of instability in an area indicated a need for the rock engineer to climb the slope.  Numerous informal inspections were carried out by highway personnel as they drove along the road.
The trial judge found that the entire system of inspection and the way it was implemented was a policy matter which did not give rise to liability. No finding was made as to whether or not the system of inspection was reasonable or whether the inspections themselves were properly carried out. The Court of Appeal upheld the finding of the trial judge and Just appealled to the Supreme Court.
issue: Is the government under a duty of care to maintain the highways and if so, are they liable if the highways are not sufficiently maintained?
decision: Appeal allowed, new trial ordered.
reasons: Cory, writing for the majority, held that the province owes a duty of care, which ordinarily extends to their reasonable maintenance, to those using its highways.  The Department of Highways could readily foresee the risk that harm might befall users of a highway if it were not reasonably maintained.  That maintenance could be found to extend to the prevention of injury from falling rock.
Government agencies may be exempt from the application of the traditional tort law duty of care if an explicit statutory exemption exists or if the decision arose as a result of a policy decision.  Whether or not a decision is characterized as a policy decision or as an operational decision rests on the nature of the decision and not on the identity of the actors.  Generally, decisions concerning budgetary allotments for departments or government agencies should be classified as policy decisions.  A policy decision may be open to challenge on the basis that it is not made in the bona fide exercise of discretion.  If after due consideration it is found that a duty of care is owed by the government agency and no exemption by way of statute or policy decision-making is found to exist, a traditional torts analysis ensues (as per
Anns v Merton London Borough Council
) and the issue of standard of care required of the government agency must next be considered.  The manner and quality of an inspection system, since it was clearly part of the operational aspect of a governmental activity, should be assessed when consideration is given to the standard of care issue.  At this stage, the requisite standard of care must be assessed in light of all the surrounding circumstances including budgetary restraints and the availability of qualified personnel and equipment.
Sopinka, in the dissent, held that the government had the power to carry out the inspections but was under no duty to do so.  Conduct within the limits of this discretion gives rise to no duty of care; conduct outside of these limits may attract a private law duty of care.
A litigant may not attack a policy and it is not appropriate for a Court to pass on it, absent evidence that a policy was adopted for some ulterior motive and not for a municipal purpose.  In order for a private duty to arise, it would have to be shown that the Rockwork Section acted outside its delegated discretion to determine whether to inspect and the manner in which the inspection is to be made.  Policy decisions are immune from review because they usually entail not only a decision to do something but also some call upon the public purse.  The government was acting within its discretion when it decided that inspections should be done and the manner in which they were to be done.  Responsibility for deciding the extent to which the inspection program was to be implemented was delegated to the Rockwork Section.
ratio: The duty of care should apply to a public authority unless there is a valid basis for its exclusion.
Policy decisions – the decision by the government about what acts to perform under a given statute – are exempt from liability; operational decisions – the decision by the government about how to perform those acts once they have been decided - are not exempt from liability."

At the time they were dismissed Machtinger was credit manager and rust‑proofing sales manager and Lefebvre was sales manager.  Each had entered into a contract for employment for an indefinite period which contained a clause allowing the respondent to terminate his employment without cause, in Machtinger's case without notice and in Lefebvre's case on two weeks' notice.  Under the provincial
Employment Standards Act
the appellants were entitled to a minimum notice period of four weeks.  After they were dismissed, the respondent paid each of them the equivalent of four weeks' salary.  The appellants brought action for wrongful dismissal and the trial judge found that they were entitled to reasonable notice of termination, and that the period of reasonable notice for Machtinger was 7 months and for Lefebvre, 7½ months, however this was overturned by the Court of Appeal.
issue: What should the notice period be in order to terminate employment if notice required in employment contract violates legislated standards?
decision: Appeal allowed, lower court judgment restored.
reasons: McLachlin, writing a concurring judgment, examined the legal principles governing the implication of terms.  She identifies three types of implied terms:
terms implied by fact (intention required);
terms implied by law (no intention required); and
terms implied by custom and usage,
and identifies #2 as the type the courts will read into a contract.  Implication of law can be from custom, for business efficiency (what is necessary in a contract), or what is reasonable (from Denning's dissent in
Liverpool City Council v Irwin
).
She finds that the Court of Appeal erred in characterizing a term implied in law as a term implied in fact, which brought in the intentionality of the parties.  Holding that the employer had a legal obligation to provide reasonable notice and that this can only be displaced by an express contrary agreement, the court imposed a reasonable term of notification on HOJ; HOJ industries.
ratio: Terms can be implied by the court based on:
custom or usage;
if necessary for business efficacy;
legal incidents of a particular class of contract."

Despite this recommendation, the board denied Homex's request for building permits and Homex sued.\r\n"",""ratio"":""The court found that the Village Board had sufficient statutory authority to deny the building permits under the zoning ordinance and comprehensive plan. The court recognized the legislative power of local governments to regulate development."", ""decision"":""The court affirmed the Village Board's decision to deny the building permits.""}  ","facts: As a condition of registration of a plan of subdivision in the Village of Wyoming, Atkinson, the owner and subdivider of the parcel of land, entered into an agreement with the Village for the installation of municipal services in the subdivision. This agreement, dated January 22, 1968, and registered September 26, 1975, provided in a general way for the owner's providing ""all the requirements financial and otherwise, of the Corporation re surfacing of roads, installation of services and drainage"". The agreement also prevented the sale of the lands in question until the agreement had been fully carried out, except with the consent of the Village, but the provision did not provide that consent would operate to release Atkinson from his obligation to the Village. Before any services were installed, Homex bought the great majority of the lots on the subdivision with the Village's consent. There was some question as to whether or not Homex had undertaken to assume the obligations of the original subdivider. Nevertheless, when protracted negotiations between the Village and Homex concerning the installation of services proved fruitless, the Village, in April 1976, pursuant to s. 29(3) (now
s. 50(3)
) of the
Planning Act
and without notice to Homex, enacted by-law 7 deeming the lots purchased by Homex not to be a registered plan of subdivision. Homex, in September 1976, made application for judicial review for an order quashing by-law 7 and, while the application was pending, checkerboarded its lots.
In November 1975, Homex and the Village negotiated the installation of services along the only street requiring them. By-law 6, enacted in December 1975, provided that it was the policy of the Village that it would neither assume responsibility for a water pipeline constructed by Homex nor permit its connection to the municipal water supply system. Homex coupled an application in judicial review to quash by-law 6 with the application for an order to quash by-law 7.
issue: What qualifies as a ""legislative"" decision such that no duty of procedural fairness applies?
decision: Appeal dismissed.
reasons: Estey, writing for the majority, held that while the passage of By-law 7 had some characteristics of a community interest, it was also clearly the culmination of the dispute between the village and Homex.  As a result he found that the decision was quasi-judicial such as to attract the principle of notice and the doctrine of
audi alteram partem
.  Despite this, however, he held that the conduct of Homex to rid itself of the obligations under the agreement with Atkinson were such that it should be denied a discretionary remedy.  There was also no basis to challenge By-law 6 as it simply stated the facts of the agreement with Atkinson.
Dickson, in the dissent, is quoted:
The courts long ago developed the general proposition that wherever a statute authorizes the interference with property or other rights and is silent as to whether or not the agency in question is required to give notice prior to the intervention in such rights, the courts will ""supply the omission of the legislature"" and require the agency in question to afford the subject an opportunity of being heard before it proceeds.
He held that an act could not be labelled ""legislative"" merely for the purpose of dispensing with fairness. It was not particularly important that the function of the municipality was classified as ""legislative"" or ""quasi-judicial"", rather, it was necessary to look at the nature of the function and to the facts of each case. The by-law in question was not of wide and general application, but was rather aimed at deliberately limiting the rights of Homex, entitling it to some procedural safeguards - at a minimum, notice of the proposed by-law and the opportunity to be heard.
ratio: In general, the courts have not imposed procedural requirements on the subordinate law-making function.
The facts of each case are key to determining the level of procedural fairness required."

Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada v Bell Canada
.  On appeal Bell is arguing that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal process is unfair because the Canadian Human Rights Commission makes regulations that the Tribunal must follow, and then appears in front of them seeking favorable decisions.  They claim that this constitutes a conflict of interest and a lack of necessary ""judicial"" independence.
issue: Does the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal lack independence and impartiality because of the power of the Canadian Human Rights Commission to issue binding guidelines for them before they appear in front of them?
decision: Appeal dismissed, case to proceed to Tribunal.
reasons: The court recognizes that Bell's claims are not without merit, however after consideration they dismiss them.  The court held that Bell did not provide sufficient evidence for their claims and also because they misunderstand impartiality - it does not mean having the freedom to decide a case however one wishes to, being subject to certain binding principles is perfectly legitimate for an impartial judiciary.  Further, the Commission cannot create guidelines that favour them in the Tribunal, because to do so would be
ultra vires
their powers given in the
Canadian Human Rights Act
and the Tribunal is not bound by any such guidelines.  The powers that the Commission has to enact guidelines under
s.27(2)
and
s.27(3)
of the
Act
are constrained as all powers to create subordinate legislation are, and therefore the system is not flawed.
ratio: Having one's decisions bound by enacted guidelines does not affect impartiality.
Agencies cannot enact subordinate legislation outside of their delegated powers."

It allowed the mother to keep her child, emphasizing her right to raise her own children.""}","facts: The aid society took SM into protection on several occasions and supervised her mother, CM, on parenting skills. On consent, SM was made a ward of the society 1989. Throughout the wardship, the society continued to work with CM and facilitated regular visits with SM, however, bonding between mother and daughter remained minimal. In December 1989, after a second four-month wardship, the society brought a status review application seeking an order of Crown wardship without access for the purposes of adoption. CM opposed the motion and the matter was dealt with sporadically throughout 1991. In February 1992 the Ontario Provincial Court ordered that SM be returned to CM on the basis that court intervention was no longer necessary to protect the child. The judge considered CM capable of acquiring the skill to care for her daughter adequately. The society obtained a stay of the order and unsuccessfully appealed to the Ontario Court (General Division). The Court of Appeal granted a stay of the order for return pending appeal and a motion for the introduction of fresh evidence. The new evidence concerned the consistent and repeated assertions of the child that she regarded her foster family as her real family, that she did not want to see her birth mother and that attempts to implement access visits with CM had become almost impossible because of the child's negative reactions - emotional, psychological and physical.  It allowed the appeal, set aside the order for the return of the child to the mother and ordered that the child be made a Crown ward without access for the purposes of adoption. CM appealed to the Supreme Court.
issue: Does the child need continued protection?
decision: Appeal dismissed.
reasons: L'Heureux-Dubé, writing for the court, reviewed the case law and determined that when a court is determining whether the wardship should be terminated or continue, the judge should not determine whether an order of wardship should have been made in the previous or earlier hearings, but instead
now
consider whether continuation of the wardship in the current proceedings is in the best interests of the child without overlooking the parents' rights.  The review hearing is not about retrying the original need for a protection order, but rather the court should determine the circumstances of the parents or parent since the last order as it relates to the situation with respect to the child's custody, including their physical, mental and emotional state since that time and also whether there is now a lifestyle, including attitudes of the parent, that warrants the child being returned to the parent or to wardship.
She lays out a two part test:
Does the child continue to need protection and require a court order for protection?
The children's aid society must continue to justify its intervention by showing that a court order is necessary to protect the child in the future.  This does not mean that an absence of proof of a deficiency in the parent's parenting capacity is enough to return the child to the parent.  A court order may be necessary to protect the child from emotional harm which would result in future if the child were taken from its psychological parents.
What is in the best interests of the children?
This should be decided through a balancing of the considerations such as the importance of the continuity of care, the child’s physical/emotional/psychological needs, the benefit of a child's bond to his/her biological parent, as well as psychological bonding of child to his/her foster family.
The furtherance and protection of the child’s best interests must take priority over the desires and interests of the parent.
The question is not merely whether the parent has seen the light and is now prepared to be a good parent, but whether or not the parent has, in factk turned a new leaf and whether he or she is now able to give to the children the care they require?

In 1977, it bid on a contract to build a section of highway in the Revelstoke area.  Its bid was successful, and Edgeworth entered into a contract with the province for the work.  Edgeworth alleges that it lost money on the project due to errors in the specifications and construction drawings.  It commenced proceedings for negligent misrepresentation against the engineering firm which prepared those drawings, N.D. Lea & Associates Ltd. as well as the individual engineers who affixed their seals to the drawings.
issue: Is the defendent exempt from liability due to the intervention of the Ministry and their liability clause?
decision: Appeal allowed.
reasons: McLachlin, writing for the majority, holds that liability for negligent misrepresentation occurs when a defendant:
makes a representation,
knows it will be relied upon, and
it is relied upon.
When Edgeworth performed the construction it was relying on N.D. Lea, not the provincial government.  Following the provisions in
London Drugs
the court finds there was no express or implied protection of the respondent in the contract.  Further, unlike in
London Drugs
the respondent could have drawn up a contract that protected it from liability.

GROQ.Gemma 2 9B,Miglin v Miglin,"```json {""facts"":""A couple used a prenuptial agreement that stipulated the wife would not acquire a claim to the husband's wealth acquired before marriage. After divorce, the wife sought spousal support based on the parties' 'household services'  and alleged contributions to the husband's business."",""ratio"":"" The trial court should consider the parties' contributions to a marital partnership, not just assets acquired during the marriage, when awarding spousal support. "", ""decision"":""Reversed and remanded.""} ```","facts: The parties were married for 14 years and had four children. They operated a resort lodge in Algonquin Park in the summer and lived in Toronto in the winter. Both parties worked in the business; the husband handled the finance and the wife the day-to-day operation of the lodge. When they separated in 1993, both parties were in their early 40s and all the children were under 8 years old. The wife wanted to stay home with the children given their ages. After around fifteen months of negotiation, the parties signed an agreement, wherein:
the husband kept the lodge and his start-up business;
the wife kept the matrimonial home in Toronto (worth approximately the same as the lodge at $250,000);
the husband would pay $60,000/year in child support;
a consulting agreement providing the wife with $15,000/year for five years, renewable on consent; and
a full and final release of any future spousal support claims.
After the divorce judgment was issued in 1997, the wife's childcare obligations changed and the consulting agreement was not renewed. She applied to the court for relief, including spousal support. The trial judge referred to the husband as ""manipulative"" and ""obsessive"". The application was allowed, child support was brought in line with the
Guidelines
and the wife was awarded support of $4,400/month for five years. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment regarding spousal support, and the husband was given leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.
issue: When should a support agreement be upheld by the courts?
decision: Appeal allowed; original support order stands.
reasons: Arbour and Bastarache, writing for the majority, stress finality and certainty as key principles in support agreements, citing
s. 9 of the
Divorce Act
; these are contracts and as long as they were entered into openly, the courts should enforce them.
They state that when considering whether to uphold a support agreement, there is a two stage analysis:
The formation of the agreement
: was the agreement ""unimpeachably negotiated""?
Factors to consider:
representation by counsel: the degree of professional assistance received by the party is relevant, but a court should not presume an imbalance of power.
circumstances: was one or both parties vulnerable and if so, did presence of counsel rectify this vulnerability?
duration of negotiations: was the agreement negotiated over a reasonable amount of time?
Substance of the agreement: does the agreement remain in substantial compliance with the objectives of the
Divorce Act
?
The analysis should not be restricted to the spousal support component – look at the whole agreement; the agreement as a whole should substantially comply with the factors and objectives of the
Act
(including the principles of certainty, autonomy and finality).
An agreement can be modified to bring it in line with the principles in the
Act
.
Agreement's correspondence to the parties' original intentions
: were the current circumstances anticipated when the agreement was drafted?
Foreseeability is interpreted broadly; circumstances do not have to have been explicitly considered/contemplated
Foreseeable circumstances include a change of job, assets going down in value, etc.

Generally, where negotiation of the agreement was correct and the agreement remains in substantial compliance with the
Act
, the court should defer to the wishes of the party and accord the agreement great weight.
Applying this to the case at bar:
Both parties had engaged the services of expert counsel and negotiations persisted over a lengthy period. Although the husband may have been the dominant party, the wife had adequate counsel; there was no hint of any vulnerabilities that might not be compensated by counsel.
The quantum of child support established in the agreement intended to provide the wife with a minimum amount of income in contemplation of her not working. While the wife argues that the business generates income, this was accounted for when the assets were valued and divided. The consulting contract reflects the parties' intention to provide the wife with a source of employment income for a limited time. The wife chose not to go back to the workforce, and had substantial assets even without support; there was no hardship or long-term disadvantage.
In the result, the original order should stand.
LeBel and Deschamps, in the dissent, stress very different concepts: interdependence and unequal bargaining power.  They propose a simpler test; is the agreement objectively unfair when considered now?
The dissenters disagree with the majority in two key areas.  One, the presence of counsel may not be enough to negate a power imbalance, and two, that very little deference should be given to agreements that deviate from the objectives in
s. 15.2(6)
of the
Act
; any fair agreement should reasonably realize the four stated objectives.
ratio: Establishes the test for enforcement of support agreements.
Miglin
applies only to final spousal support agreements.  A final agreement is one which limits the amount or duration of support or waives support entirely; it does not contemplate variation."
GROQ.Gemma 2 9B,Dobson v Dobson,"{""facts"":""Parties were married for 22 years. The wife did not work outside the home during the marriage. Divorce proceedings began and the wife filed for alimony."",""ratio"":""I don't know"",""decision"":""I don't know""}  ","facts: Cynthia Dobson was a pregnant woman.  While in the 27th week of pregnancy she was driving her car when her negligent actions caused a car accident.  The fetus was permanently injured, and was born prematurely that day.  Her son, Ryan Dobson, suffered physical and mental injuries, including cerebral palsy.  His grandfather launched a tort claim for damages against his mother.  Ryan was successful at the Court of Appeal, which his mother appealed.
issue: Should a mother be liable in tort for damages to her child arising from a prenatal negligent act that allegedly injured the fetus in her womb?
decision: Appeal allowed.
reasons: Cory, writing for the majority, finds that the mother should not be held liable in the situation because of the policy implications.  They employ the
Kamloops
test to determine if a duty of care should be owed.  It has two parts:
Is the relationship between the two parties close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there any public policy implications that should negate or limit the scope of the duty?
They find that the first part is satisfied; however the public policy implications negate the duty.  They state that there are two main reasons for this: it would violate the privacy and autonomy of women, and it is impossible to judicially define a reasonable standard of conduct for pregnant women.
McLachlin, in a concurring judgment, states that another main reason why this duty cannot be imposed is that it would violate pregnant women's rights under the
Charter
– specifically liberty and equality.  They would lose their liberty, and not be treated equally with other women in society.
Major, in the dissent, states that in order for the public policy implications to negate the duty they must add new restrictions on what the woman can do.  He says that this is not the case, because she had a duty of care to everyone else on the road, and extending that to the foetus would not change the reasonable standard of her conduct.  He says that this case deals specifically with pregnant women driving automobiles, and if the creation of duty imposed a limitation on her actions that was not there previously then the outcome would be different.  He uses the example with another pregnant woman in the car – if the same outcome occurred, then there is no question that the other woman's foetus could sue her for negligence.  He agrees that the
Kamloops
test applies, but says that the policy implications here do not negate the duty.
ratio: Pregnant women do not owe a duty of care to the foetus in their womb.
The test to determine if a duty of care is owed has two parts:
Is the relationship close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there public policy grounds to negate or limit the scope of the duty?
Is the relationship close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there public policy grounds to negate or limit the scope of the duty?"
