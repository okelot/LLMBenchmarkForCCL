A fire extinguisher was used, which completely put out the fire and no one was injured.  However, the extinguisher made a noise that caused one of the patrons in the restaurant to shout out that there was a gas leak and that there was going to be an explosion.  Chaos ensued, and the Bradfords were injured in the havoc and sued for damages.  The Bradfords were successful at trial, but this was overturned on appeal.",Appeal dismissed.,"Martland, writing for the majority, states that it is very clear that the injury resulted from the hysterical conduct of a customer that was in reaction to the fire extinguisher performing its proper function.  The negligent act was allowing too much grease to build up on the grill but the respondents had discharged their burden of care by having the extinguisher present.  This outcome cannot reasonably be seen as a consequence created by allowing too much grease to build up, and therefore Kanellos should not be liable.
Spence, in the dissent, says that the panic could have been foreseen.  It was foreseeable that the buildup of grease would necessitate the use of the extinguisher, and it is reasonable that the noise of the extinguisher would cause the hysteria, and further it is reasonable that the hysteria would result in injury.  He says that it is ""human nature"" to react this way in such circumstances.","Canada employs the
Wagon Mound
test.
When there are measures in place to eliminate potential injuries from negligent acts, and they work properly in eliminating the risk when such an act occurs then improbable outcomes resulting from the correct employment of the measure cannot be attributed to the original negligent act."
Hill v Hamilton-Wentworth,"Hill v Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police Services Board, 2007 SCC 41, [2007] 3 SCR 129",Jason George Hill,,2007,Supreme Court of Canada,"McLachlin CJ and Bastarache, Binnie, LeBel, Deschamps, Fish, Abella, Charron, and Rothstein JJ",Canada,,,"Is there a tort of negligent investigation?
If so, are the police guilty of it?","Hill was investigated by the police, arrested, tried, wrongfully convicted, and ultimately acquitted after spending more than 20 months in jail for a crime he did not commit.  Police officers suspected that Hill had committed 10 robberies. The evidence against Hill included a tip, a police officer's photo identification of Hill, eyewitness identifications, a potential sighting of Hill near the site of one of the robberies, and witness statements that the robber was Indigenous.  During their investigation, the police released Hill's photo to the media.  They also asked witnesses to identify the robber from a photo lineup consisting of Hill, who is an Indigenous person, and 11 similar-looking Caucasian foils.  The police, however, also had information that two Latino men, one of whom looks like Hill, were the robbers. Two similar robberies occurred while Hill was in custody.  Hill was charged with 10 counts of robbery but 9 charges were withdrawn before trial.  Hill was found guilty of robbery. He appealed and a new trial was ordered where he was acquitted and brought a civil action that included a claim in negligence against the police based on the conduct of their investigation.  The trial judge dismissed the claim in negligence, but the Court of Appeal unanimously recognized the tort of negligent investigation, however a majority of the court held that the police were not negligent in their investigation.  Hill appealed on the fact that the police were not found to be negligent, and the police cross-appealed on the finding of a tort of negligent investigation.",Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed.,"McLachlin, writing for the majority, held that the tort of negligent investigation exists in Canada. In the relationship between an investigating police officer and a suspect, the requirement of reasonable foreseeability was clearly made out and posed no barrier to finding a duty of care.  A clearly negligent police investigation of a suspect could cause harm to a suspect.  There is sufficient proximity between a police officer and a suspect, as the relationship between the parties was personal, close and direct, thereby giving rise to a
prima facie
duty of care.  Further, there were no broad policy reasons for declining to recognize a duty of care owed by the police to a suspect. The respondent police officers owed a duty of care to Hill, which required them to meet the standard of a reasonable officer in similar circumstances.  While she held that the investigation that led to Hill's arrest and conviction was flawed, it did not breach this standard.",There is a tort of negligent investigation in Canada.
Dobson v Dobson,"Dobson v Dobson(1999), 174 DLR (4th) 1",Cynthia Dobson,"Ryan Leigh MacLean Dobson by his Litigation Guardian, Gerald M. Price",1999,Supreme Court of Canada,"Lamer CJ and L'Heureux‑Dubé, Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin, Iacobucci, Major, Bastarache, and Binnie JJ",Canada,,,Should a mother be liable in tort for damages to her child arising from a prenatal negligent act that allegedly injured the fetus in her womb?,"Cynthia Dobson was a pregnant woman.  While in the 27th week of pregnancy she was driving her car when her negligent actions caused a car accident.  The fetus was permanently injured, and was born prematurely that day.  Her son, Ryan Dobson, suffered physical and mental injuries, including cerebral palsy.  His grandfather launched a tort claim for damages against his mother.  Ryan was successful at the Court of Appeal, which his mother appealed.",Appeal allowed.,"Cory, writing for the majority, finds that the mother should not be held liable in the situation because of the policy implications.  They employ the
Kamloops
test to determine if a duty of care should be owed.  It has two parts:
Is the relationship between the two parties close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there any public policy implications that should negate or limit the scope of the duty?
They find that the first part is satisfied; however the public policy implications negate the duty.  They state that there are two main reasons for this: it would violate the privacy and autonomy of women, and it is impossible to judicially define a reasonable standard of conduct for pregnant women.
McLachlin, in a concurring judgment, states that another main reason why this duty cannot be imposed is that it would violate pregnant women's rights under the
Charter
– specifically liberty and equality.  They would lose their liberty, and not be treated equally with other women in society.
Major, in the dissent, states that in order for the public policy implications to negate the duty they must add new restrictions on what the woman can do.  He says that this is not the case, because she had a duty of care to everyone else on the road, and extending that to the foetus would not change the reasonable standard of her conduct.  He says that this case deals specifically with pregnant women driving automobiles, and if the creation of duty imposed a limitation on her actions that was not there previously then the outcome would be different.  He uses the example with another pregnant woman in the car – if the same outcome occurred, then there is no question that the other woman's foetus could sue her for negligence.  He agrees that the
Kamloops
test applies, but says that the policy implications here do not negate the duty.","Pregnant women do not owe a duty of care to the foetus in their womb.

Just v British Columbia,"Just v British Columbia(1989), 64 DLR (4th) 689",John Just,Her Majesty the Queen in Right of the Province of British Columbia,1989,Supreme Court of Canada,"Dickson CJ and Cory, Wilson, La Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier, and Sopinka JJ",Canada,,,"Is the government under a duty of care to maintain the highways and if so, are they liable if the highways are not sufficiently maintained?","Heavy snow fall forced Just and his daughter to stop in a line of traffic by a rocky slope on a major highway.  A boulder, which worked loose from the wooded slopes above the highway, came crashing down on the appellant's car, killing the appellant's daughter and causing him very serious injuries.  Just brought an action against the provincial government contending that the government negligently failed to properly maintain the highway.
The Department of Highways had set up a system for inspection and remedial work upon rock slopes.  Inspection and recommendations were made by engineers and the work was effected by a rock scaling crew responsible for performing remedial work throughout the entire province.  The department's practice had been to make visual inspections from the highway unless rock falls or a history of instability in an area indicated a need for the rock engineer to climb the slope.  Numerous informal inspections were carried out by highway personnel as they drove along the road.
The trial judge found that the entire system of inspection and the way it was implemented was a policy matter which did not give rise to liability. No finding was made as to whether or not the system of inspection was reasonable or whether the inspections themselves were properly carried out. The Court of Appeal upheld the finding of the trial judge and Just appealled to the Supreme Court.","Appeal allowed, new trial ordered.","Cory, writing for the majority, held that the province owes a duty of care, which ordinarily extends to their reasonable maintenance, to those using its highways.  The Department of Highways could readily foresee the risk that harm might befall users of a highway if it were not reasonably maintained.  That maintenance could be found to extend to the prevention of injury from falling rock.
Government agencies may be exempt from the application of the traditional tort law duty of care if an explicit statutory exemption exists or if the decision arose as a result of a policy decision.  Whether or not a decision is characterized as a policy decision or as an operational decision rests on the nature of the decision and not on the identity of the actors.  Generally, decisions concerning budgetary allotments for departments or government agencies should be classified as policy decisions.  A policy decision may be open to challenge on the basis that it is not made in the bona fide exercise of discretion.  If after due consideration it is found that a duty of care is owed by the government agency and no exemption by way of statute or policy decision-making is found to exist, a traditional torts analysis ensues (as per
Anns v Merton London Borough Council
) and the issue of standard of care required of the government agency must next be considered.  The manner and quality of an inspection system, since it was clearly part of the operational aspect of a governmental activity, should be assessed when consideration is given to the standard of care issue.  At this stage, the requisite standard of care must be assessed in light of all the surrounding circumstances including budgetary restraints and the availability of qualified personnel and equipment.
Sopinka, in the dissent, held that the government had the power to carry out the inspections but was under no duty to do so.  Conduct within the limits of this discretion gives rise to no duty of care; conduct outside of these limits may attract a private law duty of care.
A litigant may not attack a policy and it is not appropriate for a Court to pass on it, absent evidence that a policy was adopted for some ulterior motive and not for a municipal purpose.  In order for a private duty to arise, it would have to be shown that the Rockwork Section acted outside its delegated discretion to determine whether to inspect and the manner in which the inspection is to be made.  Policy decisions are immune from review because they usually entail not only a decision to do something but also some call upon the public purse.  The government was acting within its discretion when it decided that inspections should be done and the manner in which they were to be done.  Responsibility for deciding the extent to which the inspection program was to be implemented was delegated to the Rockwork Section.","The duty of care should apply to a public authority unless there is a valid basis for its exclusion.
Policy decisions – the decision by the government about what acts to perform under a given statute – are exempt from liability; operational decisions – the decision by the government about how to perform those acts once they have been decided - are not exempt from liability."

The contract said that BC Hydro would clear their land before the towers were erected, but they did not.  As a result, BG Checo's work was more difficult and expensive.  They sued in breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation.  The lower courts allowed BG Checo to claim in both contract and tort, which BC Hydro appealed.",Appeal dismissed.,"La Forest and McLachlin, writing for the majority, decide that they can sue in both causes of action, and that there are different remedies for both actions because the law should allow wronged plaintiffs to recover in any way possible.  In the contract action, the goal is to put the plaintiff in the position that they would have been in if the contract was performed.  In the negligence action the damages could amount to any loss that reasonably stemmed from the negligence, as the goal is to put the plaintiff in the place they would have been in if the representation never happened.
They state that a tort action is only disallowed if it is explicitly set out that this is the case in the contract.  In this case, the contract did not limit the BC Hydro's duty.  Therefore, they have the ability to sue in both, but this case needs to be sent back to trial to determine the damages in tort.
They also state that the damages for breach of contract are to put the party in the position it would have been in had the contract been completed.","A plaintiff is always allowed to sue in both tort and contract, if they both apply, so long as the relevant duty necessary for the tort action is not explicitly negated in the contract.

They operated a resort lodge in Algonquin Park in the summer and lived in Toronto in the winter. Both parties worked in the business; the husband handled the finance and the wife the day-to-day operation of the lodge. When they separated in 1993, both parties were in their early 40s and all the children were under 8 years old. The wife wanted to stay home with the children given their ages. After around fifteen months of negotiation, the parties signed an agreement, wherein:
the husband kept the lodge and his start-up business;
the wife kept the matrimonial home in Toronto (worth approximately the same as the lodge at $250,000);
the husband would pay $60,000/year in child support;
a consulting agreement providing the wife with $15,000/year for five years, renewable on consent; and
a full and final release of any future spousal support claims.
After the divorce judgment was issued in 1997, the wife's childcare obligations changed and the consulting agreement was not renewed. She applied to the court for relief, including spousal support. The trial judge referred to the husband as ""manipulative"" and ""obsessive"". The application was allowed, child support was brought in line with the
Guidelines
and the wife was awarded support of $4,400/month for five years. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment regarding spousal support, and the husband was given leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.",Appeal allowed; original support order stands.,"Arbour and Bastarache, writing for the majority, stress finality and certainty as key principles in support agreements, citing
s. 9 of the
Divorce Act
; these are contracts and as long as they were entered into openly, the courts should enforce them.
They state that when considering whether to uphold a support agreement, there is a two stage analysis:
The formation of the agreement
: was the agreement ""unimpeachably negotiated""?
Factors to consider:
representation by counsel: the degree of professional assistance received by the party is relevant, but a court should not presume an imbalance of power.
circumstances: was one or both parties vulnerable and if so, did presence of counsel rectify this vulnerability?
duration of negotiations: was the agreement negotiated over a reasonable amount of time?
Substance of the agreement: does the agreement remain in substantial compliance with the objectives of the
Divorce Act
?
The analysis should not be restricted to the spousal support component – look at the whole agreement; the agreement as a whole should substantially comply with the factors and objectives of the
Act
(including the principles of certainty, autonomy and finality).
An agreement can be modified to bring it in line with the principles in the
Act
.
Agreement's correspondence to the parties' original intentions
: were the current circumstances anticipated when the agreement was drafted?
Foreseeability is interpreted broadly; circumstances do not have to have been explicitly considered/contemplated
Foreseeable circumstances include a change of job, assets going down in value, etc.

Generally, where negotiation of the agreement was correct and the agreement remains in substantial compliance with the
Act
, the court should defer to the wishes of the party and accord the agreement great weight.
Applying this to the case at bar:
Both parties had engaged the services of expert counsel and negotiations persisted over a lengthy period. Although the husband may have been the dominant party, the wife had adequate counsel; there was no hint of any vulnerabilities that might not be compensated by counsel.
The quantum of child support established in the agreement intended to provide the wife with a minimum amount of income in contemplation of her not working. While the wife argues that the business generates income, this was accounted for when the assets were valued and divided. The consulting contract reflects the parties' intention to provide the wife with a source of employment income for a limited time. The wife chose not to go back to the workforce, and had substantial assets even without support; there was no hardship or long-term disadvantage.
In the result, the original order should stand.
LeBel and Deschamps, in the dissent, stress very different concepts: interdependence and unequal bargaining power.  They propose a simpler test; is the agreement objectively unfair when considered now?
The dissenters disagree with the majority in two key areas.  One, the presence of counsel may not be enough to negate a power imbalance, and two, that very little deference should be given to agreements that deviate from the objectives in
s. 15.2(6)
of the
Act
; any fair agreement should reasonably realize the four stated objectives.","Establishes the test for enforcement of support agreements.

applies only to final spousal support agreements.  A final agreement is one which limits the amount or duration of support or waives support entirely; it does not contemplate variation."
Geffen v Goodman Estate,"Geffen v Goodman Estate, [1991] 2 SCR 353, 81 DLR (4th) 211",,,1991,Supreme Court of Canada,"Wilson, La Forest, Sopinka, Cory and McLachlin JJ",Canada,,,"Does the presumption of undue influence in special relationships require a ""manifestly disadvantageous"" contract?","Tzina Goodman was a woman who had been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder and immature personality disorder.  Tzina's mother, Annie Sanofsky, knowing that Tzina would require assistance after Annie's death,  executed a will in 1968 providing for a life estate to her daughter Tzina, and directing that on Tzina’s death her estate should be distributed to all of her (Annie’s) grandchildren. When Annie died, it was discovered that she had written a new will in 1975, which left the property which had been her home outright to her Tzina, and directed that the residue of her estate be held in trust for Tzina during her lifetime and pass on Tzina’s death to Tzina’s children.
Tzina's brothers, worried that Tzina might not take care of the property responsibly given her condition (and upset that their children had now been cut out of the will) suggested they seek counsel.  Tzina went to see a lawyer recommended by her brothers who suggested they set up a trust with her brothers as trustees, and that upon Tzina’s death the property would be divided amongst Tzina’s children, as well as her nieces and nephews.
After Tzina's death, Tzina’s son was not happy with the trust and tried to have it set aside, arguing that his mother was unduly influenced by either her brothers or the lawyer. Tzina's will had left the entire estate to her children only, in conflict with the trust.","Appeal allowed, trust upheld.","Wilson (with Cory concurring), held that a presumption of undue influence can arise in certain relationships, but each relationship must be looked at individually.  While she held that in commercial transactions, an undue disadvantage/benefit must be shown, this was not true of non-commercial transactions.  A gift is
ipso facto
disadvantageous and only a dominant relationship must be shown.  At that point the onus shifts to the alleged dominant party to show with evidence that the transaction was entered into ""as a result of [his/her] own full, free and informed thought"".
In the case at bar, Wilson found that a trust relationship was akin to a gift and triggered the presumption, however there was sufficient evidence adduced (very little contact with the brothers, independent legal advice given to Tzina) to show there was no undue influence.
La Forest (with McLachlin concurring) agreed in the result, but held that any discussion of manifest disadvantage or commercial relationships was
obiter
.  He made sure to reject, however, Wilson's comments that there is ""nothing
per se
reprehensible about persons in a relationship of trust . . . exerting influence, even undue influence, over their beneficiaries"" as well as the proposition that the law will never interfere in a contract that does not lead to a material disadvantage.
Sopinka similarly agrees in the result, but felt the case should have been restricted to the evidentiary finding that there was no undue influence and that any other analysis was unnecessary and
obiter
.","For there to be a finding of undue influence:
nature of the relationship - there must be dominance, manipulation, and coercive abuse of power;
nature of the transaction:
in commercial transactions - must be undue disadvantage or benefit
in gift or similar transactions - requires only evidence of a dominant relationship
in commercial transactions - must be undue disadvantage or benefit
in gift or similar transactions - requires only evidence of a dominant relationship"

On consent, SM was made a ward of the society 1989. Throughout the wardship, the society continued to work with CM and facilitated regular visits with SM, however, bonding between mother and daughter remained minimal. In December 1989, after a second four-month wardship, the society brought a status review application seeking an order of Crown wardship without access for the purposes of adoption. CM opposed the motion and the matter was dealt with sporadically throughout 1991. In February 1992 the Ontario Provincial Court ordered that SM be returned to CM on the basis that court intervention was no longer necessary to protect the child. The judge considered CM capable of acquiring the skill to care for her daughter adequately. The society obtained a stay of the order and unsuccessfully appealed to the Ontario Court (General Division). The Court of Appeal granted a stay of the order for return pending appeal and a motion for the introduction of fresh evidence. The new evidence concerned the consistent and repeated assertions of the child that she regarded her foster family as her real family, that she did not want to see her birth mother and that attempts to implement access visits with CM had become almost impossible because of the child's negative reactions - emotional, psychological and physical.  It allowed the appeal, set aside the order for the return of the child to the mother and ordered that the child be made a Crown ward without access for the purposes of adoption. CM appealed to the Supreme Court.",Appeal dismissed.,"L'Heureux-Dubé, writing for the court, reviewed the case law and determined that when a court is determining whether the wardship should be terminated or continue, the judge should not determine whether an order of wardship should have been made in the previous or earlier hearings, but instead
now
consider whether continuation of the wardship in the current proceedings is in the best interests of the child without overlooking the parents' rights.  The review hearing is not about retrying the original need for a protection order, but rather the court should determine the circumstances of the parents or parent since the last order as it relates to the situation with respect to the child's custody, including their physical, mental and emotional state since that time and also whether there is now a lifestyle, including attitudes of the parent, that warrants the child being returned to the parent or to wardship.
She lays out a two part test:
Does the child continue to need protection and require a court order for protection?
The children's aid society must continue to justify its intervention by showing that a court order is necessary to protect the child in the future.  This does not mean that an absence of proof of a deficiency in the parent's parenting capacity is enough to return the child to the parent.  A court order may be necessary to protect the child from emotional harm which would result in future if the child were taken from its psychological parents.
What is in the best interests of the children?
This should be decided through a balancing of the considerations such as the importance of the continuity of care, the child’s physical/emotional/psychological needs, the benefit of a child's bond to his/her biological parent, as well as psychological bonding of child to his/her foster family.
The furtherance and protection of the child’s best interests must take priority over the desires and interests of the parent.
The question is not merely whether the parent has seen the light and is now prepared to be a good parent, but whether or not the parent has, in factk turned a new leaf and whether he or she is now able to give to the children the care they require?

Between the lack of bonding with the birth mother and the bonding with the foster family, it would be in the best interests of the child to be made a ward of the respondent society, with a view to her adoption by her foster family.",Two stage test for review of a protection order.
Childs v Desormeaux,"Childs v Desormeaux, [2006] 1 SCR 643",,,2006,Supreme Court of Canada,"McLachlin CJ and Bastarache, Binnie, LeBel, Deschamps, Fish and Abella JJ",Canada,,,"Is the host at a party liable for the actions of an inebriated guest who left their party?
Do the hosts owe a duty of care to parties that might be injured by the inebriated person’s conduct?","Mr. Desormeaux was at a house party hosted by Dwight Courrier and Julie Zimmerman.  He had a history of heavy drinking and had had 12 beers to drink (blood alcohol of 0.225) and left to drive home.  Mr. Courrier walked out to the car with him and asked if he was alright; he did not show any clear signs of intoxication.  He drove away with two passengers and collided with a car head-on, killing one of the other car's passengers and severely injuring Ms. Childs, a teenager.  Ms. Childs' spine was severed, and she was paralyzed from the waist down.  Mr. Desormeaux pled guilty in court and was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.  Ms. Childs is now suing the hosts of the party and saying that they are liable for the injuries.",Appeal dismissed.,"McLachlin, writing for a unanimous court, states that there is no duty of care owed by the hosts to potential victims of the inebriated guest's actions.  Using the framework of
Cooper v Hobart
, McLachlin states that this test should be compared with similar cases to see if it falls into an existing area of law, or if it is a novel case.  She compares it with the situation of commercial alcohol providers, who have been found to be liable to third-party members of the public who are injured as a result of the drunken driving of a customer.  However, there are three main reasons why this case can be distinguished from cases involving commercial hosts.  First, commercial hosts have direct control over the alcohol consumption of their patrons.  Second, there are very strict legislative rules governing commercial hosts, while no such laws exist for private parties.  Finally, there is a contractual relationship between commercial hosts and their patrons – this is fundamentally different from the range of relationships that characterize private parties.  Therefore, as this is a novel case, it must be put through the two stage
Anns
test to determine if a duty is owed.
The first step of the test is whether or not the two parties are proximate enough for a duty to be established – it must be foreseeable that the defendant’s actions could cause harm to the plaintiff.  McLachlin concludes that there was not foreseeability in this case – it was found as a fact that the hosts did not know that Mr. Desormeaux was too drunk to drive, and simply knowing that he had a drinking problem does not means that they were liable for the consequences of his driving.
McLachlin then examines nonfeasance.  She says that foreseeability is not the only hurdle that Ms. Childs' case has to jump in order to establish a duty.  When the conduct alleged against the defendant is a failure to act, then foreseeability alone cannot establish a duty of care.  The plaintiff tries to argue that by organizing the party, the hosts created a risky situation and therefore their failure to act thereafter does not protect them from liability.  Although this would be true if it were the case, McLachlin finds that the hosts did not create a ""risky situation"" and therefore their failure to act was merely nonfeasance.  She also goes on to say that positive duties of care exist in situations of paternalistic relationships, and when a defendant is exercising a public function that includes liability to the public at large – but neither of these apply to the case at bar.  Overall, she says that it is only when third parties have a special relationship with the party in danger or a material role in managing the risk that the law may impinge on their autonomy and demand a positive duty of care.
McLachlin concludes that partygoers do not check their autonomy at the door of the party – they remain responsible for their own actions.  Unless the partygoers are reasonably relying on the hosts for their safety (such as a party on a boat, etc.), the partygoers are solely responsible for the outcomes of their own actions.  She does not need to consider the second step of the
Anns

Can-Dive was negligent in the sinking of the ship.  Fraser River recovered from their insurance company, who in turn sued Can-Dive.  However, there was a clause in the contract between Fraser River and their insurance company stating that the insurance company could not bring actions against any charterers of Fraser River, however Fraser River made an additional agreement to waive the right to the waiver of subrogation.  Can-Dive was found liable at trial but that was overturned by the Court of Appeal and Fraser River sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.",Appeal dismissed.,"Iacobucci, writing for a unanimous court, clarifies that the test in

London Drugs
as it explicitly states that charterers will be exempted in the contract. As Can-Dive was expressly mentioned in the contract, and they were doing the activity anticipated in the contract (chartering), they are covered by the limitation clause and therefore the insurance company cannot sue them. Further, the plain reading of the contract shows that this should be the case. Fraser River was acting as the agent of Can-Dive when they excluded them from liability.","The test in

However, as none of these apply, Law would have to wait until she is 65 to receive her benefits.  She is saying that these provisions violate her
s.15
Charter
right on the enumerated ground of those of age",Appeal dismissed.,"Iacobucci, writing for a unanimous court, lays out everything that the Supreme Court wants to say about ""discrimination"" under
s.15
.  He establishes the purpose of the section and how to determine whether or not discrimination has occurred.  He says first that
s.15(1)
must always be given a purposive interpretation and be viewed in the entire context of the situation.  Then he says that in order to establish a violation of
s.15
you must satisfy the three-part test:
differential treatment (need a comparator group) . . .
on the basis of an enumerated or analogous ground, and
the law has a purpose or effect that is discriminatory.
In determining if the effect is ""discriminatory"" in the third step, the court must consider:
Does the law draw a distinction:
between the claimant and other on the basis of stereotypical personal characteristics, or;
fail to take into account the claimant's disadvantaged position?
Is this differential treatment based on an enumerated or analogous ground?
Does this discriminate by imposing a burden or withholding a benefit?
between the claimant and other on the basis of stereotypical personal characteristics, or;
fail to take into account the claimant's disadvantaged position?
He says that the purpose of
s.15(1)
is ""to prevent the violation of essential human dignity . . . and to promote a society in which all persons enjoy equal recognition under the law as human beings"".  It is essential to find a conflict between the impugned law and the purpose of
s.15(1)
in order to found a discrimination claim.
He goes on to say that the equality guarantee is a comparative concept, and that you must establish a comparator group that is not discriminated against, and is similar to the claimant in most ways except for the ground cited.  The claimant, or the court may establish this.
The violation of dignity must be done in context – from the perspective of the claimant.  It must be determined if a reasonable person in the same position would feel that their human dignity had been violated.  Some important things to consider here (not necessary, help ground a claim) are:
pre-existing disadvantage
correspondence between the ground and the actual needs of the claimant
ameliorative purpose of the law
the nature and scope of the interest affected by the impugned law
A claimant never has to prove any of these things, and a decision about discrimination can be completely drawn by the court through logical inferences if necessary.  However, it may be helpful for the claimant to examine some of the factors listed above.
In the case at bar, it is clear that there is a distinction drawn on the enumerated ground of age, however the court finds that there is no discrimination.  Several factors contribute to this: younger people are not a disadvantaged group; there is no need of the claimant here as she can find work, and the law has a very ameliorative purpose.  Therefore, this is one of the few cases where there has been a distinction drawn on the basis of an enumerated ground, however this distinction does not create ""discrimination"".  Therefore, this is not a violation of the equal benefits provided by
s.15(1)
.","In order to establish a violation of
s.15
a claimant must satisfy a three-part test:
differential treatment (need a comparator group) . . .

internal inconsistencies in the rule;
the rule lacks a principled justification;
the rule is no longer applicable in some other jurisdictions;
the rule has been strongly criticized by some courts and some academics;
the rule is anachronistic; and
the rule is anomalous.",Appeal dismissed.,"Bastarache, writing for the court, held that a proposed change in the common law must be necessary to keep the common law in step with the evolution of society, to clarify a legal principle or to resolve inconsistency.  Any such change should be incremental and its consequences should be capable of assessment and that courts should not intervene if a change will have complex, uncertain and far-reaching effects.  In the case at bar, he found no compelling reasons for the abolition of the sealed contract rule; the rule is consistent with commercial reality and with other rules that apply to sealed instruments, continues to serve a useful purpose in our law, and has not caused inconvenience in commercial transactions nor great hardship.  To abolish it simply because the historical rationale for the rule is no longer important would necessarily call into question the validity of other rules that apply to sealed instruments and of other technical rules, both in the law of contract and in the law of property, which no longer appear to have any modern day rationale.  The abolition of the sealed contract rule could also have far-reaching effects on existing contractual relationships. It would have the unfair result of creating uncertainty for those who had relied on the rule in executing their contracts.
Concluding, Bastarache held that to avoid uncertainty and any unfairness to those parties who have structured their commercial relationships in accordance with the sealed contract rule, any change to the law should operate prospectively and that only a legislature has the power to create a prospective change in the law.","Generally courts are hesistant to apply sweeping changes to the common law (judicial restraint) and prefer an incremental approach.
Only the legislature has the power to create a prospective change in the law.."

He cannot work from sundown on Friday to sunup on Sunday.  The school says that he can work a special Sunday–Thursday shift but that they have to clear it with the union first.  The union rejects this shift as it is against their collective bargaining agreement and says that they will file a grievance with the school if they allow him to work the shift.  The idea of promoting Renaud so that he can choose his shifts is also rejected because it violates the agreement.  Renaud is willing to work Sunday – Thursday but the school will not go against the union because of the looming grievance so Renaud is fired.,"Appeal allowed, Renaud reinstated.","The court states that simply facing a grievance from a union is not undue hardship.  The school cannot pass the second part of the
O'Malley
test because they have not accommodated to the point of undue hardship.  They have a duty to accommodate the individual even if it violates the collective agreement as the British Columbia
Human Rights Act
(now the
Human Rights Code
) has higher standing than the collective agreement.  They cannot rely on the agreement as an excuse not to respect human rights legislation.
The court also held that both the employer and the union are responsible for accommodating employees.  If the union helps to make the rule then they must be a part of the accommodation, and if they do not help make the rule then they still cannot unreasonably stand in the way of accommodation.  They also say that the claimant must act reasonably – that is, they cannot expect a perfect solution to their problem and they must accept a reasonable outcome.","The

defence apply here?","Dube, a passenger in a car driven by Labar, was injured when it turned over.  Both had been drinking the night before and on the day of the accident, and it appeared that Dube had also been drinking in the car as a passenger.  Labar took over as driver when Dube was unable to start the car after stopping to pick up two hitchhikers.  The appellant got into the car as a passenger after a short exchange in which the respondent asserted that he was capable of driving.  The accident occurred shortly thereafter.  The car veered as Labar turned to speak to one of the hitchhikers in the back seat.  Dube attempted to grab the wheel and straighten out the car's course but his attempts eventually resulted in the car's overturning.  The appellant was unsuccessful at trial as the jury found that
volenti non fit injuria
applied and a subsequent appeal on whether
volenti
applied to a negligence case on the highways was dismissed.",Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent.,"Estey, writing for the court, discusses that in order for
volenti non fit injuria
to apply as a defence the defendant must prove that the plaintiff, expressly or through implication, agreed to exempt the defendant from liability for any damage suffered by the plaintiff.  It will only apply in cases where it can be said that there was an understanding on the part of both parties that the liability had been waived.  Obviously, this does not occur very frequently in car accident cases, and even more infrequently in cases involving intoxication, as you must be in the right state of mind to properly agree to waive the other party’s liability.
In applying this to the case at bar Estey decides that it is clear that Dube voluntarily assumed the risk when he took the wheel and that while there had been some confusion with expressing the question of
volenti non fit injuria
and contributory negligence to the jury at trial, their answers indicated that they had not been confused!","In order for the

On appeal Bell is arguing that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal process is unfair because the Canadian Human Rights Commission makes regulations that the Tribunal must follow, and then appears in front of them seeking favorable decisions.

The court held that Bell did not provide sufficient evidence for their claims and also because they misunderstand impartiality - it does not mean having the freedom to decide a case however one wishes to, being subject to certain binding principles is perfectly legitimate for an impartial judiciary.  Further, the Commission cannot create guidelines that favour them in the Tribunal, because to do so would be

After being denied claims for compensation, a claim was brought to the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Tribunal stating that the government's exclusion of chronic pain sufferers from the purview of the regular workers' compensation system violates
s. 15 of the
Charter
and is unconstitutional.  The Workers' Compensation Board appealed stating that the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to hear constitutional questions, which the Court of Appeal agreed with.",Appeal allowed.,"Gonthier, writing for a unanimous court, states that the unconstitutionality of a statute does not arise from a court's decision – it is technically unconstitutional from the time that it is passed if it violates the Constitution.  He focuses on the idea that Canadians should be able to assert their
Charter
rights whenever they need to, as it was created for the people.  He acknowledges that
Charter
challenges do not happen in isolation – they take place in the midst of other legal proceedings, and often the findings of tribunals in these cases are extremely helpful upon judicial review.  Finally, the fact that administrative tribunal decisions with respect to constitutional issues are subject to judicial review means that a superior court can always correct mistakes of law.
The general approach for determining whether a tribunal can hear a constitutional issue is that the tribunal can do so only if the subject matter of the case and remedies fall under the tribunal's jurisdiction.  Administrative tribunals that have been given the power to interpret law have the power to determine whether that law is constitutionally valid.
In this process, you must determine whether the tribunal has been granted either explicit or implicit jurisdiction to answer questions of law.  If the tribunal has the authority to answer questions of law under a certain statute, then it has the authority to determine whether the legislation is constitutional.  If this power to answer questions of law is not given explicitly, then it might have been granted implicitly.  There are several factors to examine when looking for this, including interpreting the statute as a whole, looking at the mandate of the tribunal, asking whether answering questions of law is necessary to meet this mandate, asking whether the tribunal is adjudicative in nature, etc.  It does not matter if a tribunal is found to have explicit or implied jurisdiction – they have the same result.
If a tribunal is found to have the authority to answer questions of law then it is assumed to have the power to answer constitutional questions.  This assumption may only be rebutted by the party alleging that the tribunal does not have the authority by proving that there has been an explicit withdrawal of this authority, or a clear implication to the same effect.  They must prove that the legislation clearly concludes that the legislature intended to exclude the
Charter
from the scope of law that the tribunal could hear.
Using this analysis, Gonthier decides that the Board does have jurisdiction to hear constitutional issues relating to workers' compensation.","When asking whether an administrative tribunal has the jurisdiction to handle constitutional questions:
Determine whether the tribunal has jurisdiction, either express or implied, to answer questions of law arising under the challenged provisions.
Explicit jurisdiction is found by looking in the authority-granting statute; implicit jurisdiction is found by looking at the statute as a whole and considering factors such as the tribunal's mandate and whether answering questions of law is necessary in order to meet this mandate.
If the tribunal is found to have jurisdiction to answer questions of law relating to the challenged provisions, there is an assumption that it has jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of those provisions under the
Charter
.
The party alleging that the tribunal lacks jurisdiction to apply the
Charter
may rebut the presumption by:
pointing to an explicit withdrawal of this authority in legislation, or;
convincing the court that this withdrawal is implied in the legislation.
Explicit jurisdiction is found by looking in the authority-granting statute; implicit jurisdiction is found by looking at the statute as a whole and considering factors such as the tribunal's mandate and whether answering questions of law is necessary in order to meet this mandate.

The last time he witnessed the delivery he saw a dead fly, and parts of another dead fly in one of the unopened bottles.  This image severely scarred him, causing significant psychological harm.  He is suing for the psychiatric harm resulting from the negligence of Culligan claiming he could no longer drink, shower, or have sex as a result.
Issue
How do you determine if there is recoverable psychological harm",Appeal and cross appeal dismissed.,"McLachlin, writing for the court, states that just as in any negligence claim, to get recovery for psychiatric harm you must prove that there was a duty owed, a breach of the standard of care, resulting damage, causation and sufficient proximity.  In this case it is clear that there was a duty of care owed, as manufacturers owe a duty of care to their consumers (
Donoghue v Stevenson
), and it is also clear that the Culligan's conduct breached this duty.  There was definitely damage suffered as Mustapha developed a major depressive disorder which had a significant impact on his life.  It is also proven that this damage was caused by the breach of the duty.  However, in the remoteness question you must consider if the breach would result in psychiatric harm to a reasonable person.  If it is determined that it would, then the ""thin skull"" rule applies.  However, in this case there is no question that this breach would not result in the psychiatric harm of a reasonable person.  Although this extreme reaction was imaginable, it was not reasonably foreseeable – which is the standard in negligence law.  However, she does state that if Culligan had known of Mustapha's particular vulnerability, then this type of damage would be reasonably foreseeable.","In order to make a successful claim of recover for psychiatric harm you must prove all the necessary elements of any negligence claim, however, the damage will be seen as too remote if the breach would not have resulted in the psychiatric harm of a reasonable person.

He left KRG in 2001 to work for a competitor in Richmond, a neighbouring city.  KRG commenced an action to enforce the restrictive covenant signed by Shafron which stated he would ""not for a period of three (3) years thereafter, directly or indirectly, carry on, be employed in, or be interested in or permit his name to be used in connection with the business of insurance brokerage which is carried on within the Metropolitan City of Vancouver"".  The trial judge found that the restrictive covenant was neither clear, certain nor reasonable because it used the term ""Metropolitan City of Vancouver"".  The Court of Appeal held that the restrictive covenant was enforceable, even though the term ""Metropolitan City of Vancouver"" was ambiguous.",Appeal allowed with costs.,"Rothstein, writing for a unanimous court, held that the restrictive covenant was uncertain and ambiguous.  There was no evidence that the parties unquestioningly would have agreed to remove the word ""Metropolitan"" without varying any other terms of the contract or otherwise changing the bargain.  Further, there was no indication that the parties agreed on something and then mistakenly included something else in the written contract and rectification could not be invoked to resolve the ambiguity in this case.  The Court of Appeal erred when it rewrote the restrictive covenant in this case to substitute the term ""City of Vancouver, the University of British Columbia Endowment Lands, Richmond and Burnaby"" for the term ""Metropolitan City of Vancouver"".  It was inappropriate for the Court of Appeal to rewrite the geographic scope in the restrictive covenant to what it thought was reasonable.","A restrictive covenant is

LMP v LS,"LMP v LS, 2011 SCC 64",LMP,LS,2011,Supreme Court of Canada,"McLachlin CJ and Binnie, LeBel, Deschamps, Abella, Rothstein and Cromwell JJ",Canada,,,Should the wife's spousal support be terminated?,"Shortly after the parties married in 1988, the wife was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.  During the marriage, the husband pursued his career while the wife looked after the household and children.  After the parties separated in 2002, they entered into a comprehensive agreement that was incorporated into a court order in 2003; the wife was to receive spousal support in the amount of $3,688/month, indexed, with no mention of a termination date. In 2007, the wife applied for increased child support.  The husband countered and brought a variation application under
s. 17 of the
Divorce Act
seeking a reduction and, ultimately, a cancellation of spousal support on the grounds that there had been a change in his financial circumstances and that the wife should seek employment.
The trial judge rejected the husband's claim that his financial circumstances had changed, but concluded that the wife was able to work outside the home.  The trial judge considered the active role of the mother, her ability to be at trial every day, and the wife's inability to demonstrate that she had been unable to find work.  As a result, an order was made reducing, then terminating her spousal support as of August 2010.  There was no mention of a material change of circumstances.
The Court of Appeal rejected the wife's appeal, concluding that her failure to become self-sufficient over time gave rise to a material change in circumstances. She had not looked for work in four years, so spousal support should terminate.  The wife was concerned that looking for work would disentitle her to the disability she was receiving.",Appeal allowed; original order restored.,"Abella and Rothstein, writing for the majority, say that s. 17 arrangements exist because separating spouses have an impaired ability to realistically and objectively assess their future needs, due to the emotions surrounding separation/divorce.  There is some dispute about this; the traditional view of s. 17 is that it prevents the parties from having to predict their long-term situation.  They discuss the purpose of support agreements being about apportioning risk and achieving finality and certainty.
The
Divorce Act
authorizes courts to vary spousal support terms either on an initial application for support under s. 15.2, or on an application to vary an existing court order under s. 17.  For initial applications for support (variations to support agreements or interim orders) brought under
s. 15.2(4)
, the court must consider the length of cohabitation, the functions of the spouses in the relationship, and any agreement or arrangement related to spousal support, whether formal or informal.  For variations under
s. 17(4.1)
, the court must consider the conditions, means, and needs of the other spouse and other circumstances, with no mention of prior arrangements.  Abella and Rothstein hold these are two fundamentally different processes; you cannot import one set of considerations into the other, however if there was an agreement, it is still relevant to a consideration of a material change under s. 17 as this will inform whether a material change exists.
The correct test, in the opinion of the majority, is that from
Willick
: a court must be satisfied that there has been a material change in circumstances since the making of the prior order or variation, meaning a change that, ""if known at the time, would likely have resulted in different terms"".
Applying this to the case at bar, they find that the trial judge erred in conducting a
de novo
hearing on the issue of the wife's ability to work, and thus in concluding that she should become economically self-sufficient without making a finding about whether there had been a material change in the wife's circumstances since the 2003 order.  The Court of Appeal also erred in determining that the wife had the capacity to work, and that this, coupled with the passage of time, amounted to a material change of circumstances.  Upon examination of the actual circumstances of the parties at the time the order was made and the terms of the order, it is apparent that there has been no material change of circumstances since the making of the order and that there was therefore no basis on which to vary it under
s. 17(4.1)
.  At the time of the order, the wife had multiple sclerosis and was not expected to seek employment outside the home, and there has been no material change since that time.
The support agreement contained a provision stating ""[t]his agreement is full and final"".  The majority held that this remains subject to variation under s. 17, if a material change in circumstances arises.
Cromwell, agreeing in the result, disagrees with the analysis of the majority.  He held that the decision of the court in
Miglin
, dealing with an initial support order under s. 15.2, provided the framework for variations under s. 17.  The broad language of 
conditions, means, and needs of the spouse necessarily contained a consideration of the length of cohabitation, functions, orders, etc.","Test for variations under s. 17 of the

O'Grady was convicted at trial and an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Manitoba was dismissed.",Appeal dismissed.,"Judson, writing for the majority, held that ""the power of a provincial legislature to enact legislation for the regulation of highway traffic is undoubted"".  He reaffirmed the principle that there exists a ""general area"" or ""domain"" of criminal law and the two governments can make law on the same matter by creating a distinction between the types of culpability.  He quotes from Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law:
There are only two states of mind which constitute
mens rea
, and they are intention and recklessness. The difference between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; they are opposed and it is a logical fallacy to suggest that recklessness is a degree of negligence. The common habit of lawyers to qualify the word ""negligence"" with some moral epithet such as ""wicked"", ""gross"", or ""culpable"" has been most unfortunate since it has inevitably led to great confusion of thought and of principle. It is equally misleading to speak of criminal negligence since this is merely to use an expression to explain itself.
On the facts, Judson found that there was overlap between the laws however ""there is no conflict between these provisions in the sense that they are repugnant"". The provincial law extended to include ""inadvertent negligence"" as well as regular negligence. It was enough that “the two pieces of legislation differed both in legislative purpose and legal and practical effect” to justify both of them.","The distinction between recklessness and negligence is the difference between advertence and inadvertence; recklessness is when an actor does not desire harmful consequences but forsees the possibility and consciously takes the risk.
There must be an operational incompatibility between federal and provincial law to invoke paramountcy."

If so, by what amount?","Upon separation in 1992, the father and the mother maintained joint custody of their son, whose daily residence was with the mother.  The income of the father was $87,000/year and the mother $68,000.  Nine years after separation the father applied for a reduction in child support payments pursuant to
s. 9 of the

, on the basis that he and the mother were now sharing custody.  The motions judge agreed, and reduced child support to $100/month.  The Divisional Court set aside the decision and ordered the father to pay the full table amount of $688/month.  The Court of Appeal reduced that amount to $399 after consideration of s. 9. The mother appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.",Appeal allowed.,"Bastarache, writing for the majority, considered each part of s. 9 in turn.
s. 9(a)
: the amounts set out in the applicable tables for each of the spouses
Under s. 9(a), the court is required to take the financial situations of both parents into account
Start with the set off (the difference between the table amounts for the paying parent and the receiving parent)
s. 9(b)
: the increased costs of shared custody arrangements
This section recognizes that the total cost of raising children may be greater in shared custody situations then sole custody situations.
Consider the increased costs of the shared custody arrangement (look to budgets, how parents have shared the costs that they have), and the conditions, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse and the kids.
A court should look at all the expenses of both parents under s. 9(b), not just the additional expenses resulting from an increase in access, nor just the variable or fixed expenses, nor just the expenses of the recipient parent.
s. 9(c)
: the conditions, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse and of any child for whom support is sought
Analyze the resources each parent has and the standards of living in each household.  Best interests of the child is still the primary factor; the court does not want the kids to be moving from have to have-not households.  If one spouse is close to subsistence, this militates towards the full table amount.
As the term ""household"" is used, the incomes and resources of new partners in each household would presumably be relevant.
Distinguish between initial orders or agreements and variations
A variation will raise different s. 9 issues than an initial order due to a recipient parent having incurred expenses based on legitimate expectations about support payments.

Bastarache states there is no presumption in favour of the full table amount, nor is there a presumption in favour of reduction.  He also warns against the ""cliff effect"" - a situation where a slight increase in access (such as from 39-40%) results in a massive drop off in support.  Section 9 should be interpreted so as to avoid such effects which may encourage custodial parents to prevent access beyond a certain threshold.
Applying this to the case at bar, the set-off starting point is $128/month, but considerations under s. 9(c) require this to be adjusted; the wife bought a house relying on support payments similar to those she had been receiving and a reduction of this amount would be unfair.  He concludes that a payment of $500/month is appropriate, having regard to all the circumstance.","Procedure for dealing with a claim under

The Supreme Court holds that aboriginal title definitely exists, however they were split over whether or not it had been extinguished.

However, the dissenting judges disagree and state that more must be present to prove that the lands were extinguished.

No letter ever followed and Boutilier fell on hard economic times and could not pay.  He acknowledged that he still intended to pay, and would do so when he could afford to.

gratuitous (or naked) promise
given without consideration given in return by the promisee, Dalhousie.
Dalhousie pointed to the building that they had started work on as a source of consideration. Crocket held that even if Dalhousie had relied on Boutilier's promise in commencing construction, this could not transform Boutilier's promise into consideration. This was because this was
not
something that Boutilier had
specifically requested expressly or by implication.
While the donation pledge/subscription agreement Boutilier signed implied the donation was for the betterment of the school's buildings and programs, this promise:
lacked specificity (i.e, no request for a specific building that would benefit him, or a building named after him);
did not seem to be of direct person interest to Boutilier;
and also were
not a detriment
to Dalhousie, the promisee.
Crocket also finds that estoppel does not apply here because it can only apply when a representation has been made in fact (so, when the promisor has partially performed his promise).","No naked, voluntary promise may be converted into a binding legal contract by the subsequent action of the promisee alone without the consent, express or implied, of the promisor.
For estoppel to apply, the promisee must rely on actual actions of the promisor, not merely a statement that they will do something."

The accident occurred near midnight at a major intersection on a well-lighted four lane thoroughfare; the road surface was bare and slightly damp. Two other police officers, who assisted in directing traffic while hydro lines were being repaired, left the scene and Constable Lewis continued his investigation near the centre line.  He wore the dark regulation uniform.  The flashing lights and four way flashers of the police car and hydro vehicles at the scene were clearly visible for over a quarter of a mile.",Appeal allowed.,"The court found that Lewis did not depart from police practice and was not negligent in continuing his investigation on the road without assistance.

?","The parties were married in 1978.  After 20 years of marriage, during which the wife worked, financially contributed to her husband’s continuing education, and bore his child, she suffered a significant back injury and was laid off from work.  Soon after, her husband told her that he wanted a divorce to marry another woman.  The parties divorced in 1999.  At trial, the wife was found to be entitled to support and was granted $2,250 per month until she returned to work, at which point support would be reviewed.  In 2003, an application by the husband to discontinue support payments on the basis that he was now unemployed and in financial difficulty was denied.  The chambers judge found that the wife was not self‑sufficient and remained in need of spousal support.  The Court of Appeal affirmed the ruling.  A majority of the court indicated that the
Divorce Act
did not prevent consideration of a failure to achieve self‑sufficiency as being the result, at least in part, of the emotional devastation caused by the other spouse’s misconduct.  The husband appealed stating this was contrary to
s. 15.2(5)
.",Appeal dismissed.,"Binnie, writing for the court, held it was clear that spousal misconduct was irrelevant to support outcomes, but the consequences are relevant if it affects the other spouse's ability to become self-sufficient.  There is a difference between ordering support based on misconduct and the consequences arising from it.  This theory had previously been applied to domestic abuse situations, but had not previously been applied to infidelity.  The support arose not from the infidelity, but from the wife's inability to support herself - she was a ""thin skull"" wife.  It remains incumbent on the spouse to attempt to become self-sufficient, else they risk having income imputed to them.
Turning to the nature of the original order, which was subject to review, Binnie held that judges should approve final spousal support orders and leave variations to applications under
s. 17
, which would require a change of circumstances under
s. 17(4)
.  Review under s. 15(2), as in this case, are more favourable to the party seeking review, and thus should be strictly limited in the original support order.  Regardless, on the facts of this case the onus was not important as the appeal failed on the facts.","Spousal misconduct is not relevant to spousal support, but consequences of spousal misconduct may be relevant insofar as they affect self-sufficiency.

Mitchell v Canada (Minister of National Revenue),"Mitchell v Canada (Minister of National Revenue), 2001 SCC 33, [2001] 1 SCR 911",Minister of National Revenue,Grand Chief Michael Mitchell also known as Kanentakeron,2001,Supreme Court of Canada,"McLachlin CJ and Gonthier, Iacobucci, Major, Binnie, Arbour, and LeBel JJ",Canada,,,"How is evidence dealt with when determining if an aboriginal right exists?
Is Canadian sovereignty inconsistent with some aboriginal rights?","Mitchell was a member of the Mohawk First Nation.  He attempted to bring goods back across the border from the United States and refused to pay duty, claiming that he had an aboriginal right to trade that exempted him from having to pay duty on the goods.  The goods were intended as gifts to another First Nation as a gift of friendship.
The Crown argued that there is no aboriginal right that excludes Mitchell from having to pay duties at the border, and that even if there is it is inconsistent with Canadian sovereignty and therefore necessarily invalid.  Mitchell was successful at trial and on appeal.",Appeal allowed.,"McLachlin, writing for the majority, discusses the rules of evidence and how they relate to aboriginal rights claims, and how aboriginal rights are defined generally.
She states that in the
Van der Peet
test there are three things that you look for to help define the specific aboriginal right being claimed in a case:
the nature of the action that the appellant is claiming was done pursuant to the right;
the nature of the governmental legislation or regulation alleged to infringe the right; and
the ancestral traditions and practices relied upon to establish the right.
In this case, the aboriginal right claimed is the right to bring goods north across the St. Lawrence River (not Canada/United States border, as this did not exist when the right is claimed to have existed) for purposes of trade.
McLachlin confirms that a flexible application of the rules of evidence must be used in aboriginal cases.  This includes admitting evidence of post-contact activities to prove continuity with pre-contact practices, and meaningful consideration of oral histories.  However, this does not mandate blanket acceptance of such evidence if it potentially prejudicial, irrelevant, or unreliable.
Oral histories may be admitted for two reasons:
they may offer evidence of ancestral practices that would not otherwise be available, and;
they may provide the aboriginal perspective on the right claimed.
Again, these cannot be prejudicial and must be reliable.  Overall, the courts must interpret and weigh evidence in aboriginal cases with a consideration of the special relationship between the Crown and aboriginal peoples in light of
s. 35(1)
.  However, this does not permit a complete abandonment of the rules of evidence; particularly, aboriginal evidence should not be artificially inflated to have more weight than it can reasonably support.
In the case at bar, the evidence does not support the existence of the alleged aboriginal right.  Therefore, the claim fails on that basis – but McLachlin goes on to make clear that geographic restrictions are necessary in rights linked to specific tracts of land, like hunting and fishing cases, but they are not overly important in cases that only deal with general rights (to trade, etc.).  The geographic restriction is important in this case as it deals with the right to trade in a particular area – the border along the St. Lawrence River.  Thus, if the aboriginal right were found to exist, then the Court would have to ask if the right to trade across the St. Lawrence was integral to the Mohawk.
McLachlin is hesitant to address the Canadian sovereignty question – she says that it is better left for a case that turns on the decision.
Binnie, in a concurring judgement, discusses the sovereignty question at length.  He concludes that aboriginal people, although they have individual rights, are governed by the Canadian Constitution, and that their rights can be overruled by underlying principles such as sovereignty.  For example, no one would argue that the Mohawks continue to have their aboriginal right to raid lands in Canada with their armies, because this is contrary to Crown sovereignty.  The right in this case deals with border jurisdiction issues, which are fundamentally important to sovereignty, and overrule aboriginal rights.  As a result, even if the right was found to exist and be integral it would be overruled by Canadian sovereignty.","When defining the aboriginal right in a particular case, look to:
the nature of the action that the appellant is claiming was done pursuant to the right
the nature of the governmental legislation or regulation alleged to infringe the right
the ancestral traditions and practices relied upon to establish the right.
Rules of evidence must be flexible in aboriginal rights cases, and it should include things like post-contact histories proving continuity of practices, and oral histories, however these are only included if they are reliable and not prejudicial.
Aboriginal evidence must be interpreted and weighted with the special relationship between aboriginals and the Crown in mind.
Geographical restrictions are relevant to aboriginal rights claims dealing with rights in a particular area – such as hunting, fishing, or trading in a specific area - however they are not relevant for general rights claims – such as a right to trade generally.
Canadian Crown sovereignty can potentially act to overrule legitimate aboriginal rights that are incompatible with Crown sovereignty; aboriginals must abide by the Constitution, and sovereignty is an underlying principle of the Constitution.

the nature of the governmental legislation or regulation alleged to infringe the right

Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration),"Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 SCR 817",Mavis Baker,Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,1999,Supreme Court of Canada,"L’Heureux‑Dubé, Gonthier, Cory, McLachlin, Iacobucci, Bastarache, and Binnie JJ",Canada,,,,"Mavis Baker, a Jamaican national, entered Canada on a visitor visa in August 1981. She stayed in Canada for 11 years, supporting herself illegally as a live-in domestic worker.  She had four Canadian-born children (who were therefore citizens of Canada) and four children who remained in Jamaica. After the birth of her fourth Canadian child in 1992, Baker suffered from post-partum psychosis and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Two of her children were placed in the care of their father. The other two were placed into foster care, and later returned to her care when her condition improved. During this time, she applied for welfare. Her application was rejected.
Baker was ordered deported from Canada in December 1992 for working illegally and overstaying her visitor visa. In 1993, she applied for an exemption from the requirement to apply for permanent residence from outside of Canada, based on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, pursuant to s 114(2) of the Immigration Act (now the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act). In this application, Baker cited concerns about the availability of mental health care in her home country; and that deporting her would separate her from her two children in her care, which was against the best interests of the child. Baker's application was supported by submissions from her lawyer, a letter from her doctor, and a letter from a social worker at the Children's Aid Society.
Baker's application was denied for insufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds In a letter dated April 18, 1994 and signed by Immigration Officer M Caen. The letter contained no reasons. She requested and was provided with the notes made by Immigration Officer G Lorenz, which were used by Officer Caden in making his decision. Officer Lorenz noted, among other things, that this case was a ""catastrophe"" and that, ""she will, of course, be a tremendous strain on our social welfare system for (probably) (sic) the rest of her life... I am of the opinion that Canada can no longer afford this type of generosity..""
Baker appealed the decision.
Simpson, J. found that since there were no reasons required or given, she would assume in the absence of  evidence to the contrary, that Officer Caden  acted in good faith and made a decision based on correct principles. She did not find that Officer Lorenz' notes did not raise a reasonable apprehension of bias. The Convention on the Rights of the Child does not apply in this case and is not a part of domestic law. The Convention did not give rise to a legitimate expectation that the children's interests would be a primary consideration. Simpson J certified a question for appeal regarding only the Convention.
Strayer, JA. held that as the Convention had not been implemented through domestic legisaltion, it did not have legal effect in Canada. The doctrine of Legitimate Expectations does not create substantive rights, and so it did not apply here. Strayer JA did not address the constituional validity of s 83(1) of the Immigration Act regarding certified questions.

Immigration Act

2. Were the principles of procedural fairness violated in this case?
(i) Were the participatory rights accorded consistent with the duty of procedural fairness?
The duty of procedural fairness is flexible and variable and depends on an appreciation of the context of the particular statute and the rights affected.  The purpose of the participatory rights contained within it is to ensure that administrative decisions are made using a fair and open procedure, appropriate to the decision being made and its statutory, institutional and social context, with an opportunity for those affected to put forward their views and evidence fully and have them considered by the decision-maker.  Several factors are relevant to determining the content of the duty of fairness:  (1) the nature of the decision being made and process followed in making it; (2) the nature of the statutory scheme and the terms of the statute pursuant to which the body operates; (3)  the importance of the decision to the individual or individuals affected; (4) the legitimate expectations of the person challenging the decision; (5) the choices of procedure made by the agency itself.  This list is not exhaustive.
A duty of procedural fairness applies to humanitarian and compassionate decisions.  In this case, there was no legitimate expectation affecting the content of the duty of procedural fairness.  Taking into account the other factors, although some suggest stricter requirements under the duty of fairness, others suggest more relaxed requirements further from the judicial model.  The duty of fairness owed in these circumstances is more than minimal, and the claimant and others whose important interests are affected by the decision in a fundamental way must have a meaningful opportunity to present the various types of evidence relevant to their case and have it fully and fairly considered.   Nevertheless, taking all the factors into account, the lack of an oral hearing or notice of such a hearing did not constitute a violation of the requirement of procedural fairness.  The opportunity to produce full and complete written documentation was sufficient.A duty of procedural fairness applies to humanitarian and compassionate decisions.  In this case, there was no legitimate expectation affecting the content of the duty of procedural fairness.  Taking into account the other factors, although some suggest stricter requirements under the duty of fairness, others suggest more relaxed requirements further from the judicial model.  The duty of fairness owed in these circumstances is more than minimal, and the claimant and others whose important interests are affected by the decision in a fundamental way must have a meaningful opportunity to present the various types of evidence relevant to their case and have it fully and fairly considered.   Nevertheless, taking all the factors into account, the lack of an oral hearing or notice of such a hearing did not constitute a violation of the requirement of procedural fairness.  The opportunity to produce full and complete written documentation was sufficient.
(ii) Did the failure of Officer Caden to provide his own reasons violate the principles of procedural fairness?
It is now appropriate to recognize that, in certain circumstances, including when the decision has important significance for the individual, or when there is a statutory right of appeal, the duty of procedural fairness will require a written explanation for a decision.  Reasons are required here given the profound importance of this decision to those affected.  This requirement was fulfilled by the provision of the junior immigration officer’s notes, which are to be taken to be the reasons for decision.  Accepting such documentation as sufficient reasons upholds the principle that individuals are entitled to fair procedures and open decision-making, but recognizes that, in the administrative context, this transparency may take place in various ways.
(iii) Was there a reasonable apprehension of bias in the making of this decision?
Procedural fairness also requires that decisions be made free from a reasonable apprehension of bias, by an impartial decision-maker.  This duty applies to all immigration officers who play a role in the making of decisions.  Because they necessarily relate to people of diverse backgrounds, from different cultures, races, and continents, immigration decisions demand sensitivity and understanding by those making them.  They require a recognition of diversity, an understanding of others, and an openness to difference.  Statements in the immigration officer’s notes gave the impression that he may have been drawing conclusions based not on the evidence before him, but on the fact that the appellant was a single mother with several children and had been diagnosed with a psychiatric illness.  Here, a reasonable and well-informed member of the community would conclude that the reviewing officer had not approached this case with the impartiality appropriate to a decision made by an immigration officer.  The notes therefore give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias
3. Was this discretion improperly exercised because of the approach taken to the interests of Ms. Baker’s children?
The concept of discretion refers to decisions where the law does not dictate a specific outcome, or where the decision-maker is given a choice of options within a statutorily imposed set of boundaries.  Administrative law has traditionally approached the review of decisions classified as discretionary separately from those seen as involving the interpretation of rules of law.  Review of the substantive aspects of discretionary decisions is best approached within the pragmatic and functional framework defined by this Court’s decisions, especially given the difficulty in making rigid classifications between discretionary and non-discretionary decisions.  Though discretionary decisions will generally be given considerable respect, that discretion must be exercised in accordance with the boundaries imposed in the statute, the principles of the rule of law, the principles of administrative law, the fundamental values of Canadian society, and the principles of the
Charter
.
In applying the applicable factors to determining the standard of review, considerable deference should be accorded to immigration officers exercising the powers conferred by the legislation, given the fact-specific nature of the inquiry, its role within the statutory scheme as an exception, and the considerable discretion evidenced by the statutory language.  Yet the absence of a privative clause, the explicit contemplation of judicial review by the Federal Court -- Trial Division, and the individual rather than polycentric nature of the decision also suggest that the standard should not be as deferential as “patent unreasonableness”.  The appropriate standard of review is, therefore, reasonableness
simpliciter
.
The wording of the legislation shows Parliament’s intention that the decision be made in a humanitarian and compassionate manner.  A reasonable exercise of the power conferred by the section requires close attention to the interests and needs of children since children’s rights, and attention to their interests, are central humanitarian and compassionate values in Canadian society.  Indications of these values may be found in the purposes of the Act, in international instruments, and in the Minister’s guidelines for making humanitarian and compassionate decisions.  Because the reasons for this decision did not indicate that it was made in a manner which was alive, attentive, or sensitive to the interests of the appellant’s children, and did not consider them as an important factor in making the decision, it was an unreasonable exercise of the power conferred by the legislation.  In addition, the reasons for decision failed to give sufficient weight or consideration to the hardship that a return to the appellant’s country of origin might cause her.","There are five considerations when determining the level of procedure required in a particular decision:

When they set the terms, it was agreed that Springer would notify Dawson when he had obtained a pilot for his helicopter so that Dawson could leave his post with the military and come with them to show them the area, and was entitled to a percentage of the earnings if they decided to develop the land.  When a pilot became available Springer notified Dawson, however he also stated that based off of third party advice they would probably not be exploring the area that year.  Dawson did not reply.  Without notifying Dawson, the defendants explored the region and later contracted with another party for the development of the land.  Dawson sued for breach, but was unsuccessful in the lower courts.","Appeal allowed, remitted to the British Columbia Supreme Court for the assessment of damages.","In the dissent, Kerwin argues that no contract was formed.  However, the remaining justices all agree that a bilateral contract was indeed formed.  They state that the performance that was required of Springer was notifying Dawson that a pilot was ready, and taking him along on the exploration.

Copyright Act
?","The Law Society of Upper Canada (LSUC) has a reference/research library offering a custom and self serve photocopy service. CCH Canadian (CCH) sues seeking a declaration of subsistence and ownership of copyright in 11 specific works, a declaration that LSUC has infringed on their copyright, and a permanent injunction preventing further copying. LSUC denies the infringement and files a counterclaim for declaration that copyright is not infringed when a single copy of a reported decision, case summary, statute, regulation or a limited selection of text from a treatise is made by the Great Library staff or patron for research purposes.","Appeal allowed, Court of Appeal decision overturned.","The publishers’ works are original and protected by copyright act. Applied a test for originality:

No evidence the copiers were used in manner inconsistent with copyright law. The court held that the Court of Appeal erred in finding that LSUC's posting of the notice constitutes an express acknowledgement that copiers will be used in an illegal manner. LSUS lacks sufficient control over the works patron chooses to copy, purposes for copying, or photocopiers themselves. LSUC does not have to go out and prove that people who use copiers or take advantage of the custom photocopy service have done so in accordance with the law; the burden of proof rests on CCH (can rely on the fair dealing exception).

quantum meruit
?
What is the effective date of the beginning of spousal support?","The parties had been in a common law relationship for 26 years.  Kerr was a secretary and Baranow was a longshoreman.  Kerr had entered the relationship in a state of financial crisis; was just divorced with one child and the bank attempting to foreclose on her house.  Baranow paid off her debts and mortgage and transferred her house and vehicle to him.  Kerr moved into his house where they lived for the rest of the relationship.  He paid the mortgage, shared the grocery bill.  She paid the utilities for both properties, the insurance, her share of the grocery bill and did the housekeeping and cooking.  Throughout the relationship they maintained separate accounts and had no joint assets.  Everything they owned of significance was in one name or the other.  In 1991 Kerr had a disabling stroke.  As her health declined Baranow took early retirement at a reduced pension to look after her.  By 2006 he was burned out and placed her in an extended care home; days later she served him with papers seeking property division.  At the time of trial, Kerr had $101,000 in savings and $171,000 in RRSPs, plus a van worth $20,000.  Baranow had the family home worth $942,000, savings of $525,000, RRSPs valued at $240,000 and a camper worth $5,000.  Each party claimed unjust enrichment against the other.  Kerr also made a claim for spousal support, but did not apply for interim support.
The trial judge awarded Kerr $315,000, 1/3 of the value of the home in Baranow's name that they shared, both by way of resulting trust and unjust enrichment, based on the conclusion that she had provided $60,000 worth of equity and assets at the beginning of the relationship.  Kerr was also awarded $1,739 per month in spousal support effective the day proceedings commenced.  The Court of Appeal allowed the husband's appeal; Kerr did not make any financial contribution to the acquisition and improvement of the property so her claims were dismissed.  The appeal court also held that commencement date of support should be the date of trial.
Vanasse and Seguin lived in a common-law relationship for 12 years.  They had two children, aged 10 and 8.  When the relationship ended, Vanasse claimed spousal support, child support and compensation for unjust enrichment.  While they were in a relationship, Seguin was developing a network operating system.  Vanasse resigned her position at CSIS and relocated to Halifax, where the husband moved his business.  She devoted herself full-time to running the household and raising the children.  The trial judge concluded that the husband could not have built up the company as he did but for the wife's efforts.  The husband had received $11,000,000 from the sale of the company.
It was agreed that Seguin was unjustly enriched by the contributions of his partner, Vanasse, during their 12-year common law relationship. At trial, she was awarded $5,472 per month in child support and $3,800 per month in spousal support until June 2015.  She was also awarded a monetary award for unjust enrichment in the amount of $996,500.  The Court of Appeal set aside that award and, while ordering a new trial, directed that the proper approach to valuation was to place a monetary value on the services provided by Vanasse to the family, taking due account of Seguin's contributions by way of set-off.","In
Kerr
, appeal on spousal support allowed; order of trial judge restored. The appeal from the order dismissing Kerr's unjust enrichment claim allowed; new trial ordered. The appeal from the order dismissing Kerr's claim in resulting trust dismissed. The order for a new hearing of Baranow's counterclaim should be affirmed.
In
Vanasse
, appeal allowed; decision of trial judge restored.","Cromwell, writing for the majority, held that with respect to the nature of the monetary remedy, the remedy for unjust enrichment was not restricted to an award based on a fee-for-services approach.  Where the unjust enrichment was most realistically characterized as one party retaining a disproportionate share of assets resulting from a joint family venture, and a monetary award was appropriate, it should be calculated on the basis of the share of those assets proportionate to the claimant's contributions.  For the claimant to prove there was a joint family venture, they must provide evidence of:
mutual effort
Did the parties work collaboratively to common goals?
Did the couple have children?
How long was the relationship?
economic integration
Did they have any joint assets?
Did they share expenses and accumulate common savings?
Basic expense sharing only evidence of cohabitation.

What did the parties intend to do?
Was it always intended that each would keep their own portion?

Once a joint family venture has been established, the plaintiff must demonstrate a link or causal connection between his or her contributions and the acquisition, preservation, maintenance or improvement of the disputed property, and that a monetary award would be insufficient, at which point a share of the property proportionate to the claimant's contribution could be impressed with a constructive trust in his or her favour (i.e. there is not a presumption of an equal share).  Where the contributions of both parties over time resulted in an accumulation of wealth, an unjust enrichment occurred when one party retained a disproportionate share of the assets that were the product of their joint efforts following the breakdown of their relationship.
For cases where no joint family venture exists, the court was less clear.  The value survived approach (the increase in value of an asset since cohabitation) was approved, but little guidance was given as to when it should be used.
There was a clear link between Vanasse's contribution and the accumulation of wealth.  The trial judge took a realistic and practical view of the evidence and took into account Seguin's non-financial contributions and periods during which Vanasse's contributions were not disproportionate to Seguin and thus her judgment should be restored.
The court held that the general rule is that support is granted back to the date of the initial application, based on not wanting to penalize the recipient based on how long the case takes to get to trial.  When considering how far back spousal support should go, the court will consider:
whether support was sought effective from the commencement of proceedings;
the conduct of the payor broadly relevant to the support obligation;
the circumstances of the spouse seeking support; and
any hardship occasioned by the award.
The Court of Appeal made two errors in changing the date of retroactivity to the date of trial:
They stated that Kerr had no need despite the fact she was living in a long-term care facility with three other people, and wanted support to have private room.
They also faulted Kerr for not applying for interim spousal support.  The Supreme Court points out that interlocutory applications have high physical, financial and emotional legal costs; requiring interim applications prolongs rather than expedites proceedings.","Monetary damages are not restricted to

To demonstrate a joint family venture, the complainant must adduce evidence of:
mutual effort
economic integration

If a joint family venture can be proven, then if the applicant can demonstrate a link between their contributions and that a monetary award would be insufficient, they are entitled to a share of the assets proportionate to their contributions.
To be entitled to a monetary remedy from a joint family venture, the claimant must show both
that a joint family venture exists, and
that there is a link between his/her contributions to it and the accumulation of assets/wealth.

In 1977, it bid on a contract to build a section of highway in the Revelstoke area.  Its bid was successful, and Edgeworth entered into a contract with the province for the work.  Edgeworth alleges that it lost money on the project due to errors in the specifications and construction drawings.  It commenced proceedings for negligent misrepresentation against the engineering firm which prepared those drawings, N.D. Lea & Associates Ltd. as well as the individual engineers who affixed their seals to the drawings.",Appeal allowed.,"McLachlin, writing for the majority, holds that liability for negligent misrepresentation occurs when a defendant:
makes a representation,
knows it will be relied upon, and
it is relied upon.
When Edgeworth performed the construction it was relying on N.D. Lea, not the provincial government.  Following the provisions in
London Drugs
the court finds there was no express or implied protection of the respondent in the contract.  Further, unlike in
London Drugs
the respondent could have drawn up a contract that protected it from liability.","Employees who are not ""powerless"" will not benefit from an employer's exemption."

Rawlings,1963,Supreme Court of Canada,"Taschereau, Cartwright, Abbott, Martland and Ritchie JJ",Canada,,,Was there sufficient consideration in the substituted contract for it to be binding?,"Foot owed Rawlings money for several debts.  Rawlings was quite old and realized that the current agreement would make it hard for him to enjoy the money, and therefore offered a new agreement whereby the appellant would pay less money monthly as long as he gave post-dated cheques every six months for the following six months.  If he performed this, then the respondent would not sue.  Both parties signed this agreement on July 17, 1958.  Foot followed this agreement, however after cashing the November 1960 cheque an action was brought for the balance.",Appeal is allowed; the new agreement may continue and the respondent cannot sue unless the appellant fails to keep up the payments.,After a careful review of the case law the judge decides that the respondent relinquished his right to sue when he entered into the substitute agreement.  The consideration in the agreement was the appellant's agreement to provide the post dated cheques in advance purely for the benefit of the respondent so that he could enjoy the money before his death.,"Accepting terms that benefit the creditor for convenience can amount to consideration.
A negotiable instrument such as a cheque, or an object of a value less than the debt, can be consideration even if the amount is less than the cash debt."
Barrick v Clark,"Barrick v Clark, [1951] SCR 177, [1950] 4 DLR 529",,Frank J. Clark,1951,Supreme Court of Canada,"Rinfret CJ and Taschereau, Kellock, Estey, and Locke JJ",Canada,,,What is the reasonable amount of time that the offer must be left open for?,"Barrick owned farmland that Clark wanted to buy. They entered into negotiations, which resulted in Clark making an offer of $14,500. Barrick wrote back stating that the price was $15,000 and if the price was satisfactory the deal could be closed immediately. At this time Clark was away on a hunting trip. His wife received the letter and responded asking Barrick to hold the offer open until her husband returned in around ten days. Barrick did not reply. Thirteen days later, Barrick sold the property to someone else for $15,000. Clark did not return until twenty days after his wife received the offer. Clark sought specific performance of the alleged contract between him and Barrick. The case was dismissed at trial, but found for Clark on appeal. Barrick appealed to the Supreme Court.",Appeal allowed.,"Estey states that the reasonable time that this specific offer must be left open for is longer than for goods that fluctuate in price (such as stocks), or for perishable goods.  The fields could not be used until spring anyway, which must be considered.  However, through his actions and insistence on replying to Barrick's letters by wire Clark indicated that he did not have a spring date in mind, but wanted to get the sale done, or go off to pursue other options.  Further, Barrick did not respond to Mrs. Clark's letter, so he was not bound to any particular period of offer.  In the result, leaving the offer open for thirteen days was a reasonable time, as Barrick had indicated that he wanted to accept and close the sale as soon as possible.
Kellock, in a concurring judgment, discusses that much of the Court of Appeal's reasoning was based off claims that Barrick made concerning his intent to sell as soon as possible outside of his communication with Clark (the deal could be closed ""immediately"").  The offer by Barrick was clear that it should be dealt with swiftly, and thus the time frame was valid.","The reasonable time to accept an offer can be determined from the conduct and language of the two parties, the nature of the goods and other reasonable indications.
Statements made outside of a contract have no bearing in deciding whether there was an agreement."
McGill University Health Centre (Montreal General Hospital) v Syndicat des employés de l'Hôpital general de Montréal,"McGill University Health Centre (Montreal General Hospital) v Syndicat des employés de l'Hôpital general de Montréal, 2007 SCC 4",McGill University Health Centre (Montreal General Hospital),,2007,Supreme Court of Canada,,Canada,,,What deference should be given to collective agreements in determining what amounts to undue hardship?,"The claimant worked for the McGill Health Centre and took a leave of absence after she had a nervous breakdown.  Before she returned she was in a car accident and there was no indication that she was ever going to come back to work.  The allotted period of accommodation for sick leave agreed to in the collective agreement expired and the Health Centre fired the claimant.  The Health Centre claims that the collective agreement set out what amounts to undue hardship and to go further would require them to pass this point.  The union argues that the accommodation does not begin until after the negotiated period has expired.  The arbitrator dismissed the case, the Quebec Supreme Court upheld this decision and the Quebec Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and sent the case back to the arbitrator.","Appeal allowed, dismissal justified.","The court held that although the collective agreement must be taken into consideration when figuring out what amounts to undue hardship it is not decisive.  In all cases you must assess whether the period allotted for amount to undue hardship, even if there is an agreement between the two parties.  They also noted that in many cases these allotments are much more generous than the human rights legislation would allow for.  The reason why you must examine the agreements so closely is that you are not allowed to contract out of human rights so, if the allotted period does not accommodate up to the point of undue hardship, then you must go beyond it.  However these agreements are generally looked upon positively because it shows that the employer tried to accommodate and to say that they are useless would discourage people from making the agreements.
In this case they determine that the period allotted did amount to the point of undue hardship and therefore the dismissal was justified.  This case passes all three parts of the
Meiorin
test, and therefore the employer is justified in their discrimination on the ground of disability.
In a judgment concurring in the result,
Abella J
states that there was no
prima facie
case of discrimination proven in this case.  This must be proven before there can be a claim of discrimination brought and that automatic termination cases do not automatically represent
prima facie
discrimination.","Agreements allowing for periods of accommodation will be taken into consideration when determining if undue hardship was reached, but they are not conclusive.
In all cases you must determine if the allotted period was in fact accommodation to the point of undue hardship.
You cannot contract out of human rights legislation."

Does the owner have to accept the lowest bid, even when there is a privilege clause?","Defence Construction tendered for construction bids according to 11 specific documents.  There was an indicated privilege clause which stated ""the lowest or any other tender shall not necessarily be accepted"".  One of the four bidders (Sorochan) submitted a bid suggesting an alternative cost (in effect disqualifying their bid).  The owner accepted this.  M.J.B. Enterprises had the next lowest bid.  The appellant brought an action stating that this alternative cost invalidated their tender and therefore M.J.B. should have been awarded the contract.","Appeal allowed.  The contract with Sorochan is not binding, however the respondent does not have to contract with M.J.B.","The court holds that it is an implied term in tenders that only complying bids will be accepted and that Sorochan's bid did not comply with the terms – therefore, it cannot be accepted.  In accepting the disqualified bid the owner is in a breach of Contract A (as outlined in the analysis of
Ron Engineering
) with the other bidders.  Although the privilege clause does not overrule this obligation to only accept compliant bids, it does allow the owner to not simply accept the lowest bidder.  Therefore, the owner was under no obligation to contract with the plaintiff.  However, on the balance of probabilities the court finds that M.J.B. would have been awarded the contract and assesses damages of $398,121.27 based on an agreement of liability arranged before the case at bar","A privilege clause is only compatible with accepting compliant bids.
In the absence of a privilege clause, you are most likely to be bound to accept the lowest offer."

Does the plaintiff's engineering background mean that he understood the dangers more thoroughly and therefore submitted to them?",,"Appeal allowed, trial judge's ruling restored and costs awarded to the appellants.","Laskin, writing for the court, states that manufacturers owe a duty of care to the users of their products and this duty does not end simply because a warning was given.  He says that warnings must be very explicit and the general warning will not suffice to eliminate liability where the likelihood of injury may increase depending on the surroundings.
The trial judge found that this was the case, and also that the plaintiff did not voluntarily assume the risk simply because he was an engineer.  However, the Court of Appeal disagreed and held that the plaintiff's ""special knowledge"" exonerated the manufacturer.  The Supreme Court agreed with the trial judge, and states that
volenti non fit injuria
can only apply where it can be proven that the plaintiff appreciated the risk and willingly took it, which is not the case here.","In order for
volenti non fit injuria
to apply the plaintiff must appreciate the risk associated with their actions and willingly take it despite the risk.

Less than three months later, appellant requested the child's return and, when the respondent adoptive parents refused, she revoked her consent to the still incomplete adoption and sought an order restoring him to her custody. The trial judge dismissed the application as he found her ""unmindful of her parental duties"" because of her surrender of the child to the respondents. He then considered the welfare of the child, and found that, although both parties could provide the child with satisfactory upbringing, the child's best interests would not be served by returning him to his natural mother. The benefits to the child of maintaining the blood ties to his natural mother were outweighed by those resulting from maintenance of his present home stability and his existing parental bonds to the adoptive parents. The majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the judgment.",Appeal dismissed.,"McIntyre, writing for the court, held that this case may be dealt with on the general consideration of the welfare of the child. Where the governing statute preserves and dictates the application of the rules of equity, when the court exercises its
parens patriae
jurisdiction in questions of contested custody, including contests between a natural parent and adoptive parents, it must consider the welfare of the child the predominant factor and give it effect in reaching its determination.
The welfare of the child must be decided on a consideration of all relevant factors, including the general psychological, spiritual and emotional welfare of the child. The Court must choose the course which will best provide for the healthy growth, development and education of the child so that he will be equipped to face the problems of life as a mature adult. Parental claims must be seriously considered but must be set aside where the welfare of the child requires it.","The best interests of child, including principles of consistency and stability, places a major emphasis on bonding.

He goes on to state that the only

Is the entity one that acts pursuant to statutory authority specifically granted to it to enable it to further an objective that government seeks to promote in the broader public interest? (
statutory authority and public interest test
)
When she applies this test to the case at bar she determines that universities pass all three of the tests.  She says that pass the first part because they could not operate without the funding that they are given, and that they only exist through enabling statutes.  They pass the second step because it has always been a function of the Canadian government to promote education and freethinking in the country.  They pass the third part because, by giving the universities these powers, the government is asking them to make decisions that are in promotion of the public interest.  However, she makes it clear that simply passing one part of the test will not always lead to something being deemed as ""government"".","Universities are not ""government"", at least in their negotiations with their employees, and therefore the
Charter
does not apply to these actions.
Some university actions that are directly related to the powers given to them in their governing statutes might be considered ""government"" actions and subject to the
Charter
.
To be deemed to be ""government"", the government must control you."

This agreement, dated January 22, 1968, and registered September 26, 1975, provided in a general way for the owner's providing ""all the requirements financial and otherwise, of the Corporation re surfacing of roads, installation of services and drainage"". The agreement also prevented the sale of the lands in question until the agreement had been fully carried out, except with the consent of the Village, but the provision did not provide that consent would operate to release Atkinson from his obligation to the Village. Before any services were installed, Homex bought the great majority of the lots on the subdivision with the Village's consent. There was some question as to whether or not Homex had undertaken to assume the obligations of the original subdivider. Nevertheless, when protracted negotiations between the Village and Homex concerning the installation of services proved fruitless, the Village, in April 1976, pursuant to s. 29(3) (now
s. 50(3)
) of the
Planning Act
and without notice to Homex, enacted by-law 7 deeming the lots purchased by Homex not to be a registered plan of subdivision. Homex, in September 1976, made application for judicial review for an order quashing by-law 7 and, while the application was pending, checkerboarded its lots.
In November 1975, Homex and the Village negotiated the installation of services along the only street requiring them. By-law 6, enacted in December 1975, provided that it was the policy of the Village that it would neither assume responsibility for a water pipeline constructed by Homex nor permit its connection to the municipal water supply system. Homex coupled an application in judicial review to quash by-law 6 with the application for an order to quash by-law 7.",Appeal dismissed.,"Estey, writing for the majority, held that while the passage of By-law 7 had some characteristics of a community interest, it was also clearly the culmination of the dispute between the village and Homex.  As a result he found that the decision was quasi-judicial such as to attract the principle of notice and the doctrine of
audi alteram partem
.  Despite this, however, he held that the conduct of Homex to rid itself of the obligations under the agreement with Atkinson were such that it should be denied a discretionary remedy.  There was also no basis to challenge By-law 6 as it simply stated the facts of the agreement with Atkinson.
Dickson, in the dissent, is quoted:
The courts long ago developed the general proposition that wherever a statute authorizes the interference with property or other rights and is silent as to whether or not the agency in question is required to give notice prior to the intervention in such rights, the courts will ""supply the omission of the legislature"" and require the agency in question to afford the subject an opportunity of being heard before it proceeds.
He held that an act could not be labelled ""legislative"" merely for the purpose of dispensing with fairness. It was not particularly important that the function of the municipality was classified as ""legislative"" or ""quasi-judicial"", rather, it was necessary to look at the nature of the function and to the facts of each case. The by-law in question was not of wide and general application, but was rather aimed at deliberately limiting the rights of Homex, entitling it to some procedural safeguards - at a minimum, notice of the proposed by-law and the opportunity to be heard.","In general, the courts have not imposed procedural requirements on the subordinate law-making function.
The facts of each case are key to determining the level of procedural fairness required."

They say that what he chooses to do with his money should not be taken into consideration when assessing damages – the courts have no control over the plaintiff's expenditure of the award (nor would Andrews have been limited in expenditure of his earnings had he been able to work).  Dickson sets $100,000 as the upper limit for non-pecuniary loss in cases such as this, stating that a cap needs to be implemented as they were constantly rising, specifically commenting on the situation in the United States.","Full compensation is the paramount concern of the courts in cases of severely injured victims.

The father had sole interim custody after separation but then the parties entered into an informal shared custody arrangement where neither party paid support.  Three years later the mother brought an action in Alberta for retroactive and ongoing support.  The chambers judge awarded her prospective support but not retroactive.  The Court of Appeal allowed her appeal, but found no blameworthy conduct or willful failure to disclose on the part of the father.
Three children were born in the course of a common law relationship. After separation the children lived with the mother, and some months later the father paid $150 in child support pursuant to a maintenance agreement which was increased to $300/month following a consent order.  The mother brought an action for retroactive support.  The father had low income and high access costs and resisted the action.  The chambers judge held retroactive support would constitute hardship.
Parents married in 1984 and divorced in 1991. After separation the two children lived with their mother and a divorce judgment ordered the father to pay $700/month in child support.  In 2000 the mother signaled an intention to request increased support.  The father voluntarily increased his payments, but still below the table amount.  The mother was unaware that his income had increased dramatically as they lived in different cities.  At chambers, the judge granted her application for retroactive support based on the table amount, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal in a 2-1 judgment.
Parents divorced in 1996.  The children lived with the father, then one of the children moved to lived with the mother.  The father had a lot more income and the mother asked for an increase of support but the father rejected the request.  The mother was hesitant to take the case to court because earlier proceedings had caused a rift between the mother and children.  The chambers judge held that this was an appropriate circumstance for a retroactive award, and he calculated it from January 1, 2003 onward, to be paid in the amount of $500/month, as a ""reasonable compromise"" that best fit the situation of the parties.  The Court of Appeal upheld the decision.
All of these proceedings were merged before the Supreme Court.","The appeals in
DBS
and
TAR
should be allowed and the decisions of the chambers judges restored.  The appeals in
Henry
and
Hiemstra
should be dismissed.","Justice Bastarache, writing for the majority, held that children are entitled to child support from both parents commensurate with their income.  To prevent liability for retroactive support, any changes in income should be reported to the custodial parent.  If this is not done and an application is brought to enforce a change, four factors should be analysed to see if retroactive support is warranted:
Undue delay: does the recipient have a reasonable excuse for not seeking support earlier?
Any voluntary, intentional choice not to apply for an increase will militate against retroactive support.  There is a balancing here; a child should not be punished for a poor choice of the parent.
Was there blameworthy conduct on the part of the payor?
This is interpreted broadly; anything that privileges the payor's interests over his/her children's right to an appropriate amount of support.
Could the payor have reasonably believed that they were discharging their support obligations?
The more significant a change in income, the more likely a court will find a payor's behaviour blameworthy if they do not proactively disclose.
Need of child/benefit: would the child benefit from retroactive award based on their needs/circumstances?
If a child's needs are being met by the current support, this will militate against a retroactive award.
Would a retroactive award cause hardship to payor?
This is a distinct element from the
s. 10
undue hardship test.
Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.

Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.
Turning to how far back retroactive payments should go, it turns on the conduct of the parents.  If there was no blameworthy behaviour, the retroactivity should go to when the custodial parent informs the payor that they are seeking additional support.  Generally there will be a limit of 3 years.  For blameworthy parents, the retroactivity should continue to when the support should have changed and did not, without limit.
As to the amount of a retroactive payment, the court should follow the
Guidelines
, but the court has broad discretion to craft a remedy that would be fair having regard to all the circumstances, including hardship on the payor.
Applying this to the cases...
This was an initial application for child support.  The parents had a shared custody arrangement that thought that meant no child support was payable (see
Contino v Leonelli-Contino
).  The incomes of the parents were relatively equal and due to the shared custody any money going to one household would simply be removed from the other.  Due to the lack of blameworthy conduct and the lack of benefit to the children, no retroactive support was awarded.
The father from whom support was being sought was low income (~$23,000/year) and he was supporting a second family.  Any retroactive award would cause his household hardship.  The access costs for him were also high.  Because of the lack of blameworthy conduct, the hardship a retroactive award would cause, and the fact that the standard of living in the custodial household was higher, no retroactive support was awarded.
In this case, the mother had broached the subject with the father but could not afford a lawyer to fight the case.  She was intimidated by her ex-husband and did not know much about his financial situation as he lived in another city.  The husband had had a huge income increase and held it from her, as well as saying that she should have managed her money better to better provide for their kids and that he was paying all he could afford.  Due to the large amount of blameworthy conduct and the large discrepancy in the amount he was paying and the table amount, the court awarded $100,000 in retroactive support.
As in
Henry
, the parties had very different incomes; the father earned more than $100,000K/year, much more than the mother, and he gave no financial support when the need arose.  The mother said she had not wanted to litigate because of the effect it had had on her daughter the last time they litigated.  The court held that the delay of mother was not unreasonable, and the father had no reasonable grounds on which to believe the level of support he was paying was reasonable, and thus the award granted at trial was upheld.
Abella, dissenting in part, had three issues with the decision of Bastarache.
The presumptive starting date of effective notice: the payor has the information on when their income changes, so it is impractical and unrealistic to expect the recipient to keep tabs on the payor’s income; the date should be when the income changes.
The role of blameworthy conduct: the conduct of the payor should be immaterial; the whole obligation depends on the income increase, conduct of the parties is irrelevant.
The three year cutoff: Abella finds this arbitrary - any cutoff of this type should be found in statute, not created by the courts.","Retroactive child support orders should no longer be rare or difficult to obtain.
Established the framework for assessing claims where there is a large, undisclosed swing in income.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?
Children are entitled to support from both parents commensurate with their ability to pay.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?
This case is sometimes referred to as the ""don't-ask-don't-tell"" case, as the
Federal Child Support Guidelines
do not require payors to update their income information each year, merely that the paying parent make disclosure at least once a year upon request of recipient parent (

John Burrows Ltd. v Subsurface Surveys Ltd.,"John Burrows Ltd. v Subsurface Surveys Ltd., [1968] SCR 607, 68 DLR (2d) 354",John Burrows Ltd.,,1968,Supreme Court of Canada,"Cartwright CJ and Judson, Ritchie, Spence, and Pigeon JJ",Canada,,,What is necessary for estoppel to apply?,"Burrows agreed to sell all of the shares in his company to Whitcomb, in the name of his corporation – Subsurface Surveys. Of the cost, $42,000 was to be a promissory note paid annually for 10 years with 6% interest.  The two were friends at the time of the deal.  Whitcomb was late on a few payments, but Burrows did not take any action.  Eventually their relationship turned sour, and when Whitcomb was late on another payment Burrows demanded the full $42,000 in payment, as per the condition in the contract stating this was the remedy for late payments.  Whitcomb claimed estoppel as defence.  Burrows was successful at trial, Whitcomb appealed and Burrows won on appeal again.",Appeal allowed.,"Ritchie, writing for the court, states that estoppel does not apply in this case.  He says that for estoppel to apply the conduct of Burrows must amount to a promise or assurance intended to alter the legal relations between the two, and that it is impossible to infer this from the facts of the case.  He was simply acting as a friend, and not entering into any negotiations with Whitcomb over new terms of payment.
Ritchie, J.: “this type of equitable defence cannot be invoked unless there is some evidence that one of the parties entered into a course of negotiation which had the effect of leading the other to suppose that the strict rights under the contract would not be enforced […] this implies that there must be evidence from which it can be inferred that the first party intended that the legal relations created by the contract would be altered as a result of the negotiations.”","In order for a promise to be capable of being relied upon and having estoppel available as a defence, it must be a promise or assurance
intended
to alter the legal relations between the two parties.
A friendly gesture is not a binding agreement, and if it is relied upon estoppel will not be available as a defence."

s.15 of the
Charter
.  They were successful at the lower courts, which the government appealed.",Appeal dismissed.,"McLachlin and Bastarache, writing for the majority, first state that it is clear that non-reserve aboriginal status qualifies as an analogous ground, but distinctions based on analogous grounds do not always constitute discrimination.  They hold that markers (grounds) of discrimination cannot change from case to case; if something is deemed to be an analogous ground then it will be considered one in all cases.  Further, they find that all of these grounds share the common ground that they often serve as the basis for stereotypical decisions made not on the basis of merit but a personal characteristic that is either unchangeable, or changeable only at an unacceptable cost to personal identity.  Here, the comparator group that is identified is the members of the band who do live on the reserve.  It is clear that there is a distinction created, and they decide that it is discrimination as it causes them to choose between living on a reserve and exercising their political rights – and that this is not saved by
s.1
.
L'Heureux-Dube, in the dissent, further discusses the discrimination.  She classifies analogous grounds and states that they are things that, considered by a reasonable person in the position of the claimant, would be deemed important to their identity, personhood and belonging.  There are several things that help to determine this: being immutable, or very difficult to change in terms of personal identity; lacking in political power; disadvantaged or vulnerable; and inclusion in human rights codes are all factors.  She then goes further into why this distinction is discrimination - the interest here is very important, and that it is completely prohibited, showing a serious violation.  It reinforces the view that aboriginals who do not live on reserves are ""less aboriginal"" than those who do, which harms the dignity of the group.","Analogous grounds serve as the basis for stereotypical decisions made not on the basis of merit but a personal characteristic that is either unchangeable, or changeable only at an unacceptable cost to personal identity.
If something is deemed to be an analogous ground in one case, it will be in all future cases regardless of different circumstances."
Nova Scotia (Attorney General) v Walsh,"Nova Scotia (Attorney General) v Walsh, 2002 SCC 83, [2002] 4 SCR 325",The Attorney General of Nova Scotia,,2002,Supreme Court of Canada,"McLachlin CJ and L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier, Iacobucci, Major, Bastarache, Binnie, Arbour, and LeBel JJ",Canada,,,"Is the definition of ""spouse"" in
s.2(g) of the
Matrimonial Property Act
a violation of
s.15(1) of the
Charter
?","Walsh and Bona cohabited for 10 years. Upon the breakdown of their relationship, Walsh applied for spousal support, child support and a declaration that the definition of ""spouse"" in
s.2(g) of the
Matrimonial Property Act
was unconstitutional for failing to provide her with the presumption, applicable to married spouses, of an equal division of matrimonial property, in violation of
s.15(1) of the
Charter
. The trial judge held that the exclusion of common law spouses from the definition of ""spouse"" did not constitute discrimination within the meaning of
s.15(1)
. The Court of Appeal set aside the decision, concluding that the legislation infringed
s.15(1)
and that the infringement was not justifiable under
s.1 of the
Charter
.","Appeal allowed,
s.2(g)
is not unconstitutional.","Bastarache, writing for the majority, held the distinction between unmarried and married couples in the
Act
does not affect the dignity of these persons and does not deny them access to a benefit or advantage available to married persons. Bastarache applied the test set out in
Law v Canada
to test whether a statute violates s.15(1):
does the law imposes differential treatment between the claimant and others, in purpose or effect;
are one or more enumerated or analogous grounds of discrimination the basis for the differential treatment; and
does the law in question has a purpose or effect that is discriminatory within the meaning of the equality guarantee?
Bastarache found that
s.2(g)
passed the first two questions of the test, but not the third. Many opposite sex individuals in conjugal relationships choose to avoid marriage to avoid the legal consequences that flow from it. To ignore the differences among cohabiting couples presumes a commonality of intention that simply does not exist. Finding this was not the case effectively nullifies the individual's freedom to choose alternative family forms and to have that choice respected by the state. Unmarried cohabitants maintain their respective proprietary rights and interests throughout the duration of their relationship and at its end. If they so choose they are free to marry, enter into domestic contracts, own property jointly or register as domestic partners. As a result, the application of the
Act
to married persons only is not discriminatory in this case as the distinction reflects and corresponds to the differences between those relationships.
Gonthier, concurring with the majority, held that the situation of couples who have chosen life commitment through marriage is not comparable to that of unmarried couples. With married couples, there is a permanent and reciprocal life commitment, to which the legislature has attached a presumption of equal division of matrimonial assets. Unmarried couples do not make that same commitment, and rights and duties akin to marriage should not follow.
When couples marry, they commit to respect the consequences and obligations flowing from their choice. It is this choice that legitimates the system of benefits and obligations attached to marriage generally, and, in particular, those relating to matrimonial assets. To extend the prrgfdjngdfbesumption of equal division of matrimonial assets to common law couples would be to intrude into the most personal and intimate of life choices by imposing a system of obligations on people who never consented to such a system. To presume that common law couples want to be bound by the same obligations as married couples is contrary to their choice to live in a common law relationship without the obligations of marriage.
L'Heureux-Dubé, in the dissent, held that the
Act
was discriminatory and could not be saved under
s.1
as unmarried heterosexual couples were deserving of the same protections that the [
Act
was passed to provide. Heterosexual unmarried cohabitants have historically faced disadvantages through a legal system that fails to acknowledge them as legitimate family forms. Many heterosexual unmarried cohabitants cohabit not out of choice but out of necessity. For many, choice is denied them by virtue of the wishes of the other partner. To deny them a remedy because the other partner chose to avoid certain consequences creates a situation of exploitation.","The application of the
Matrimonial Property Act
only to married couples is not unconstitutional. The right to choose to avoid the consequences of marriage or registered domestic partnerships must be respected."

s.15 of the
Charter
?
If so, can the violation be saved under
s.1
?
Are financial concerns enough to satisfy the
s.1
test?","The Newfoundland government recognized that women were being paid less then men in many areas of employment in their province.  To correct this situation they implemented a pay equity program that was to begin in 1988 and lead to equal wages for men and women.  However, the province experienced severe financial difficulties and was forced to pass a bill stating that this pay equity program would not start until 1991.  The appellant union argues that this was a violation of the
s.15
rights of female workers, and that they should be reimbursed for the lost wages from 1988 to 1991.  This amounts to approximately $24 million.  The government also made many other cuts to their spending during these three years including hospital beds and teachers' salaries.  Both at trial and at appeal the delay was found to amount to discrimination, but that the violation was saved under
s.1
.",Appeal dismissed.,"Binnie, writing for a unanimous court, agrees that this delay of the program amounts to discrimination as it creates a distinction on an enumerated ground, and all four of the contextual factors lead to the conclusion that it is discriminatory.  Binnie then reviews past Supreme Court decisions that state that in general financial concerns were not enough to justify discrimination under
s.1 of the
Charter
.
Binnie agree with this, and holds that in normal circumstances financial concerns are not enough to justify saving discrimination under
s.1
.  However, he finds that this extreme financial crisis was not a ""normal circumstance"".  They look at evidence of how many other programs were cut back, and what an asset the saved $24 million was at that time.  As a result, he determines that there was definitely a pressing and substantial objective on the part of the government in passing this legislation.  He concludes that although this impairment may not seem minimal to the women, it was proportional to the government's objective in the financial crisis.
The savings ($24 million) were so substantial that the benefit of relocating that money outweighed giving it to the women.  For further proof that the government acted reasonably, the court looks to evidence that they offered the members of the union a chance to look for alternative means such as cutbacks and layoffs, but they declined.  $24 million was such a large amount of money in the difficult time that it was more reasonable to spend it elsewhere.  There was no evidence of bad faith on the part of the government, further shown by their agreement to only delay, and not scrap the pay equity plan.
The final argument concerns the Newfoundland Court of Appeal judge's opinion that another step should be added to the
Oakes
test to ensure that the courts are giving enough deference to the legislatures.  He wrote a great deal about this, and stated that the courts are infringing on legislative action too much and should not be able strike down legislation easily, even when it violates the
Charter
.  However, Binnie does not agree with this and states that the division of powers is taken into consideration in the
Oakes
test to a satisfactory level.  It is the court's duty to keep the legislature in check with the Constitution, and limiting this power is nonsensical.","Financial issues can play a role in determining if something that is deemed to be discriminatory can be saved under
s.1
; in times of severe financial crisis money must be allocated accordingly.
The division of powers (judicial deference to the legislatures) is given sufficient consideration in the
Oakes
test.
In 2006, the provincial government made an
ex gratia
payment of $24 million to a group of unions in recognition of the sacrifice made by the women in the 1988-91 period."

The husband has been previously married and said he would never again allow a division of his assets. His wife had withdrawn from legal practice to raise their children. Prior to the wedding, they discussed that the wife sign a marriage contract which kept their property separate, but with the wife earning a percentage of the matrimonial home each year she lived there. She obtained independent legal advice and was advised that the agreement was ""grossly unfair"", but nevertheless signed the agreement with a few amendments. He brought assets worth approximately $1.6 million into the marriage while the wife entered the relationship with no assets and heavily in debt. The parties separated after nine years. Under the agreement, the wife was entitled to property valued at $280,000 while the husband was entitled to property worth $1.2 million. The husband argued that the contract should be followed while the wife argued that the contract should be set aside of the division reapportioned due to unfairness under s. 65(1) of the British Columbia
Family Relations Act
(now replaced by the s. 93 of the
Family Law Act
).
The trial judge concluded that the agreement was unfair and ordered a reapportionment on a 60/40 basis in favour of the husband regarding most of the family assets with each party entitled to a half interest in the matrimonial home and contents. In addition, the husband was ordered to pay spousal support. The Court of Appeal upheld this judgement which the husband appealed.",Appeal allowed.,"Bastarache, writing for the majority, held that in order for a marriage contract to be enforceable it must operate fairly at the time of distribution.  To determine whether the contract was substantively fair, the court must consider whether the circumstances of the parties at the time of separation were within their reasonable contemplation when the contract was formed and whether they made adequate arrangement to address those anticipated circumstances.  In general, courts should respect the private arrangements made regarding division of property,
especially
where they obtained independent legal advice.  In the case at bar, the financial and domestic arrangement unfolded just as the parties expected.  The marriage contract was fair, in light of the relevant legislation, the provisions in the agreement for child and spousal support, and the circumstances of the parties at the time of separation.
Deschamps, dissenting in part, placed far less emphasis on the fairness of the negotiations, foreseeability and independent legal advice – unfair negotiations could result in a fair agreement, and vice versa.  She held that the standard of ""unfair"" under the
Family Relations Act
was a lower standard than the ""unconscionability"" standard in Nova Scotia or the ""grossly unfair"" standard in Saskatchewan.  Section 65(1) simply states that ""[i]f the provisions for division of property ... would be unfair..."" and the court should not elevate that to the higher standards in other jurisdictions.  Fairness also is not the same as equal division; different parties bring different assets to a marriage and an even division might be unfair.  Further, the evaluation of fairness should occur at the time of the application to the court, and not at the time when the contract was made.","Test to determine the fairness of a marriage contract:
Apply the agreement as written
Award any other entitlements such as child or spousal support
In light of the appropriate provincial statute and with regard to all the circumstances, is the outcome of the agreement unduly harsh?

, immediately upon the granting of the divorce.  Despite Bruker's repeated requests, Marcovitz consistently refused to provide a
get
for 15 years, required for her to remarry under Jewish law.  Bruker sought damages for breach of the agreement.  Marcovitz argued that his agreement to give a
get
was not valid under Quebec law and that he was protected by his right to freedom of religion from having to pay damages for its breach.  At trial the judge found that the agreement was valid and binding and that a claim for damages was within the domain of the civil courts.  The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, stating that because the substance of the obligation was religious in nature, it was a moral obligation and was therefore unenforceable by the courts under Quebec's
Civil Code
.",Appeal allowed.,"Abella, writing for the majority, held that the fact that a dispute had a religious aspect did not by itself make it non-justiciable.  Recognizing the enforceability by civil courts of agreements relating to religious divorce addressed the gender discrimination that religious barriers to remarriage represented and alleviated the effects they may have on extracting unfair concessions in a civil divorce.  Nothing in the
Civil Code
prevented someone from transforming his or her moral obligations into legally valid and binding ones.  Marcovitz's claim to religious freedom must be balanced and reconciled with countervailing rights, values, and harm, including the extent to which it was compatible with Canada's fundamental values.  Abella found that any impairment to Marcovitz's religious freedom was significantly outweighed by the harm both to the Bruker personally and to the public's interest in protecting fundamental values such as equality rights and autonomous choice in marriage and divorce.",Moral obligations can be transformed into legally binding obligations if formalized.
