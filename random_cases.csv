Miglin v Miglin,"Miglin v Miglin, 2003 SCC 24",Eric Juri Miglin,Linda Susan Miglin,2003,Supreme Court of Canada,"McLachlin CJ and Gonthier, Iacobucci, Major, Bastarache, Binnie, Arbour, LeBel and Deschamps JJ",Canada,,,When should a support agreement be upheld by the courts?,"The parties were married for 14 years and had four children. They operated a resort lodge in Algonquin Park in the summer and lived in Toronto in the winter. Both parties worked in the business; the husband handled the finance and the wife the day-to-day operation of the lodge. When they separated in 1993, both parties were in their early 40s and all the children were under 8 years old. The wife wanted to stay home with the children given their ages. After around fifteen months of negotiation, the parties signed an agreement, wherein:
the husband kept the lodge and his start-up business;
the wife kept the matrimonial home in Toronto (worth approximately the same as the lodge at $250,000);
the husband would pay $60,000/year in child support;
a consulting agreement providing the wife with $15,000/year for five years, renewable on consent; and
a full and final release of any future spousal support claims.
After the divorce judgment was issued in 1997, the wife's childcare obligations changed and the consulting agreement was not renewed. She applied to the court for relief, including spousal support. The trial judge referred to the husband as ""manipulative"" and ""obsessive"". The application was allowed, child support was brought in line with the
Guidelines
and the wife was awarded support of $4,400/month for five years. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment regarding spousal support, and the husband was given leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.",Appeal allowed; original support order stands.,"Arbour and Bastarache, writing for the majority, stress finality and certainty as key principles in support agreements, citing
s. 9 of the
Divorce Act
; these are contracts and as long as they were entered into openly, the courts should enforce them.
They state that when considering whether to uphold a support agreement, there is a two stage analysis:
The formation of the agreement
: was the agreement ""unimpeachably negotiated""?
Factors to consider:
representation by counsel: the degree of professional assistance received by the party is relevant, but a court should not presume an imbalance of power.
circumstances: was one or both parties vulnerable and if so, did presence of counsel rectify this vulnerability?
duration of negotiations: was the agreement negotiated over a reasonable amount of time?
Substance of the agreement: does the agreement remain in substantial compliance with the objectives of the
Divorce Act
?
The analysis should not be restricted to the spousal support component – look at the whole agreement; the agreement as a whole should substantially comply with the factors and objectives of the
Act
(including the principles of certainty, autonomy and finality).
An agreement can be modified to bring it in line with the principles in the
Act
.
Agreement's correspondence to the parties' original intentions
: were the current circumstances anticipated when the agreement was drafted?
Foreseeability is interpreted broadly; circumstances do not have to have been explicitly considered/contemplated
Foreseeable circumstances include a change of job, assets going down in value, etc.

Generally, where negotiation of the agreement was correct and the agreement remains in substantial compliance with the
Act
, the court should defer to the wishes of the party and accord the agreement great weight.
Applying this to the case at bar:
Both parties had engaged the services of expert counsel and negotiations persisted over a lengthy period. Although the husband may have been the dominant party, the wife had adequate counsel; there was no hint of any vulnerabilities that might not be compensated by counsel.
The quantum of child support established in the agreement intended to provide the wife with a minimum amount of income in contemplation of her not working. While the wife argues that the business generates income, this was accounted for when the assets were valued and divided. The consulting contract reflects the parties' intention to provide the wife with a source of employment income for a limited time. The wife chose not to go back to the workforce, and had substantial assets even without support; there was no hardship or long-term disadvantage.
In the result, the original order should stand.
LeBel and Deschamps, in the dissent, stress very different concepts: interdependence and unequal bargaining power.  They propose a simpler test; is the agreement objectively unfair when considered now?
The dissenters disagree with the majority in two key areas.  One, the presence of counsel may not be enough to negate a power imbalance, and two, that very little deference should be given to agreements that deviate from the objectives in
s. 15.2(6)
of the
Act
; any fair agreement should reasonably realize the four stated objectives.","Establishes the test for enforcement of support agreements.

applies only to final spousal support agreements.  A final agreement is one which limits the amount or duration of support or waives support entirely; it does not contemplate variation."
LeBlanc v LeBlanc,"LeBlanc v LeBlanc, [1988] 1 SCR 217",Florence T. LeBlanc,Jean-Marie LeBlanc,1988,Supreme Court of Canada,"Estey, McIntyre, Wilson, La Forest and L'Heureux-Dubé JJ",Canada,,,Should an unequal division of assets be granted?,"The parties divorced after 26 years of marriage.  The wife ran and successfully expanded a restaurant which provided the major part of the family income.  She was able to buy a house, a summer cottage and a car, all of which were registered in her name.  The husband worked regularly in the earlier years of the marriage but later only at occasional odd jobs.  He was an alcoholic and drank heavily on a daily basis. On the application for a division of property under the
Marital Property Act
, the trial judge found that, apart from a contribution of $1,000 towards the purchase of the house and some occasional assistance in the operation of her business, the husband had contributed nothing by way of child care, household management or financial provision during the marriage and thus he was not entitled to an equal share of the marital property and awarded him the sum of $6,000.
The Court of Appeal set aside the trial judgment, holding it was inconceivable that the husband had not performed during the marriage ""useful deeds"" and that any contribution to the fulfillment of the spouses' joint responsibilities entitles each spouse to an equal share in the marital assets independent of the degree and quality of the contribution.",Appeal allowed.,"La Forest, writing for the court, held that the trial judge made no error in deciding this case.  Under
7(f) of the
Marital Property Act
(equivalent to
s. 13 of the
Matrimonial Property Act
) the court was entitled to consider the circumstances surrounding acquisition and maintenance of property.  He held that the court should not put itself in the position of weighing the degree to which spouses contributed to increasing the value of an asset, but where the asset was acquired/improved almost exclusively by one spouse with negligible input from the other, it is appropriate for a judge to exercise their discretion to make an unequal division.","Where one spouse makes virtually no or a negligible contribution to matrimonial assets, a
s. 13
division may be appropriate.
Courts should not engage in a weighing exercise generally; simply where there is a significant disparity."
Innisfil (Township) v Vespra (Township),"Innisfil (Township) v Vespra (Township), [1981] 2 SCR 145",The Corporation of the Township of Innisfil,,1981,Supreme Court of Canada,"Laskin CJ and Martland, Ritchie, Dickson, Beetz, Estey and Lamer JJ",Canada,,,"What does it mean for cross-examination to be ""reasonably required for a full and fair disclosure of all matters relevant to the issues in the proceeding""?","These proceedings began with an application by the City of Barrie to annex parts of the Townships of Innisfil, Oro and Vespra. At a hearing of the Ontario Municipal Board, the projected population of Barrie in 2011 (150,000) assumed importance. While evidence was being led by Innisfil on the issue, the Minister forwarded a letter, through a departmental representative, to the Board advising it of the population allocations in a planning study prepared for the region. The Board ruled that it was bound by government policy as communicated in the letter and would not permit cross-examination on the letter. The Board issued its annexation order on the basis of the government's population figures.
The Divisional Court, on appeal, found that the Board had denied Innisfil natural justice and had therefore acted beyond its jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal reversed the Divisional Court, but agreed that the Board had committed an error of law, albeit within its jurisdiction, by refusing to hear evidence of forecast population before giving the Minister's letter preponderant weight. Innisfil appealed to the Supreme Court.",Appeal allowed.,"Estey, delivering the judgment of the court, first turned to the right of Innisfil to cross-examine a representative of the Minister on the letter. It was not for the appellate court to withhold the right to cross-examination because in its judgment it was doubtful, or even impossible, in the court's view, for the appellant to advance its case by such cross-examination. The decision to exercise the right was solely that of the holder of the right.
The relationship of ""independent"" agencies to the executive branch of government, in so far as that relationship affected the procedural rights of the parties before the tribunal, could only be determined by reference to the agency's parent statute, and other relevant statutes or common law prescribing procedural norms. It was not for the court to go behind the ground rules or modify them because of perceived far-reaching effects. If on its face an agency were held out to be ""independent"" of the executive, it remained that way for all purposes until the Legislature altered the position and procedure of the agency. A court would require the clearest statutory direction to enable the executive branch to give binding policy directions to an administrative tribunal and to make such directions immune from cross-examination. Even though the role assigned the Board in the legislation as drafted could entail some conflict between the administrative result and certain government policies, the remedy did not lie in the Board and Court denying the citizen his statutory right to oppose annexation.",
Newfoundland (Treasury Board) v NAPE,"Newfoundland (Treasury Board) v Newfoundland and Labrador Association of Public and Private Employees, 2004 SCC 66, [2004] 3 SCR 381",Newfoundland and Labrador Association of Public and Private Employees,Her Majesty The Queen in Right of Newfoundland as represented by the Treasury Board and the Minister of Justice,2004,Supreme Court of Canada,"McLachlin CJ and Major, Bastarache, Binnie, LeBel, Deschamps, and Fish JJ",Canada,,,"Does the delay of the implementation of the pay equity program violate the women's rights under
s.15 of the
Charter
?
If so, can the violation be saved under
s.1
?
Are financial concerns enough to satisfy the
s.1
test?","The Newfoundland government recognized that women were being paid less then men in many areas of employment in their province.  To correct this situation they implemented a pay equity program that was to begin in 1988 and lead to equal wages for men and women.  However, the province experienced severe financial difficulties and was forced to pass a bill stating that this pay equity program would not start until 1991.  The appellant union argues that this was a violation of the
s.15
rights of female workers, and that they should be reimbursed for the lost wages from 1988 to 1991.  This amounts to approximately $24 million.  The government also made many other cuts to their spending during these three years including hospital beds and teachers' salaries.  Both at trial and at appeal the delay was found to amount to discrimination, but that the violation was saved under
s.1
.",Appeal dismissed.,"Binnie, writing for a unanimous court, agrees that this delay of the program amounts to discrimination as it creates a distinction on an enumerated ground, and all four of the contextual factors lead to the conclusion that it is discriminatory.  Binnie then reviews past Supreme Court decisions that state that in general financial concerns were not enough to justify discrimination under
s.1 of the
Charter
.
Binnie agree with this, and holds that in normal circumstances financial concerns are not enough to justify saving discrimination under
s.1
.  However, he finds that this extreme financial crisis was not a ""normal circumstance"".  They look at evidence of how many other programs were cut back, and what an asset the saved $24 million was at that time.  As a result, he determines that there was definitely a pressing and substantial objective on the part of the government in passing this legislation.  He concludes that although this impairment may not seem minimal to the women, it was proportional to the government's objective in the financial crisis.
The savings ($24 million) were so substantial that the benefit of relocating that money outweighed giving it to the women.  For further proof that the government acted reasonably, the court looks to evidence that they offered the members of the union a chance to look for alternative means such as cutbacks and layoffs, but they declined.  $24 million was such a large amount of money in the difficult time that it was more reasonable to spend it elsewhere.  There was no evidence of bad faith on the part of the government, further shown by their agreement to only delay, and not scrap the pay equity plan.
The final argument concerns the Newfoundland Court of Appeal judge's opinion that another step should be added to the
Oakes
test to ensure that the courts are giving enough deference to the legislatures.  He wrote a great deal about this, and stated that the courts are infringing on legislative action too much and should not be able strike down legislation easily, even when it violates the
Charter
.  However, Binnie does not agree with this and states that the division of powers is taken into consideration in the
Oakes
test to a satisfactory level.  It is the court's duty to keep the legislature in check with the Constitution, and limiting this power is nonsensical.","Financial issues can play a role in determining if something that is deemed to be discriminatory can be saved under
s.1
; in times of severe financial crisis money must be allocated accordingly.
The division of powers (judicial deference to the legislatures) is given sufficient consideration in the
Oakes
test.
In 2006, the provincial government made an
ex gratia
payment of $24 million to a group of unions in recognition of the sacrifice made by the women in the 1988-91 period."

internal inconsistencies in the rule;
the rule lacks a principled justification;
the rule is no longer applicable in some other jurisdictions;
the rule has been strongly criticized by some courts and some academics;
the rule is anachronistic; and
the rule is anomalous.",Appeal dismissed.,"Bastarache, writing for the court, held that a proposed change in the common law must be necessary to keep the common law in step with the evolution of society, to clarify a legal principle or to resolve inconsistency.  Any such change should be incremental and its consequences should be capable of assessment and that courts should not intervene if a change will have complex, uncertain and far-reaching effects.  In the case at bar, he found no compelling reasons for the abolition of the sealed contract rule; the rule is consistent with commercial reality and with other rules that apply to sealed instruments, continues to serve a useful purpose in our law, and has not caused inconvenience in commercial transactions nor great hardship.  To abolish it simply because the historical rationale for the rule is no longer important would necessarily call into question the validity of other rules that apply to sealed instruments and of other technical rules, both in the law of contract and in the law of property, which no longer appear to have any modern day rationale.  The abolition of the sealed contract rule could also have far-reaching effects on existing contractual relationships. It would have the unfair result of creating uncertainty for those who had relied on the rule in executing their contracts.
Concluding, Bastarache held that to avoid uncertainty and any unfairness to those parties who have structured their commercial relationships in accordance with the sealed contract rule, any change to the law should operate prospectively and that only a legislature has the power to create a prospective change in the law.","Generally courts are hesistant to apply sweeping changes to the common law (judicial restraint) and prefer an incremental approach.
Only the legislature has the power to create a prospective change in the law.."
Geffen v Goodman Estate,"Geffen v Goodman Estate, [1991] 2 SCR 353, 81 DLR (4th) 211",,,1991,Supreme Court of Canada,"Wilson, La Forest, Sopinka, Cory and McLachlin JJ",Canada,,,"Does the presumption of undue influence in special relationships require a ""manifestly disadvantageous"" contract?","Tzina Goodman was a woman who had been diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder and immature personality disorder.  Tzina's mother, Annie Sanofsky, knowing that Tzina would require assistance after Annie's death,  executed a will in 1968 providing for a life estate to her daughter Tzina, and directing that on Tzina’s death her estate should be distributed to all of her (Annie’s) grandchildren. When Annie died, it was discovered that she had written a new will in 1975, which left the property which had been her home outright to her Tzina, and directed that the residue of her estate be held in trust for Tzina during her lifetime and pass on Tzina’s death to Tzina’s children.
Tzina's brothers, worried that Tzina might not take care of the property responsibly given her condition (and upset that their children had now been cut out of the will) suggested they seek counsel.  Tzina went to see a lawyer recommended by her brothers who suggested they set up a trust with her brothers as trustees, and that upon Tzina’s death the property would be divided amongst Tzina’s children, as well as her nieces and nephews.
After Tzina's death, Tzina’s son was not happy with the trust and tried to have it set aside, arguing that his mother was unduly influenced by either her brothers or the lawyer. Tzina's will had left the entire estate to her children only, in conflict with the trust.","Appeal allowed, trust upheld.","Wilson (with Cory concurring), held that a presumption of undue influence can arise in certain relationships, but each relationship must be looked at individually.  While she held that in commercial transactions, an undue disadvantage/benefit must be shown, this was not true of non-commercial transactions.  A gift is
ipso facto
disadvantageous and only a dominant relationship must be shown.  At that point the onus shifts to the alleged dominant party to show with evidence that the transaction was entered into ""as a result of [his/her] own full, free and informed thought"".
In the case at bar, Wilson found that a trust relationship was akin to a gift and triggered the presumption, however there was sufficient evidence adduced (very little contact with the brothers, independent legal advice given to Tzina) to show there was no undue influence.
La Forest (with McLachlin concurring) agreed in the result, but held that any discussion of manifest disadvantage or commercial relationships was
obiter
.  He made sure to reject, however, Wilson's comments that there is ""nothing
per se
reprehensible about persons in a relationship of trust . . . exerting influence, even undue influence, over their beneficiaries"" as well as the proposition that the law will never interfere in a contract that does not lead to a material disadvantage.
Sopinka similarly agrees in the result, but felt the case should have been restricted to the evidentiary finding that there was no undue influence and that any other analysis was unnecessary and
obiter
.","For there to be a finding of undue influence:
nature of the relationship - there must be dominance, manipulation, and coercive abuse of power;
nature of the transaction:
in commercial transactions - must be undue disadvantage or benefit
in gift or similar transactions - requires only evidence of a dominant relationship
in commercial transactions - must be undue disadvantage or benefit

Hunter Engineering Co. v Syncrude Canada Ltd.,"Hunter Engineering Co. v Syncrude Canada Ltd., [1989] 1 SCR 426, 57 DLR (4th) 321, [1989] WWR 385",,,1989,Supreme Court of Canada,"Dickson CJ and Estey, McIntyre, Wilson, Le Dain, La Forest and L'Heureux‑Dubé JJ",Canada,,,,"Syncrude ordered 32 mining gearboxes from Hunter which were fabricated by a subcontractor. The specifications were provided by Syncrude, but Hunter designed the gearboxes. The second contract, between Syncrude and Allis-Chambers, was for the supply of an extraction conveyor system and included four extraction gearboxes to drive the machinery.  Those gearboxes were built according to the same design as the mining gearboxes supplied by Hunter and were fabricated by the subcontractor.  The gearboxes entered service on November 24, 1977.  Both contracts included time-limited warranties. The Allis-Chambers warranty also stated it represented the only warranty given, and no other warranty or conditions, statutory or otherwise, were to be implied.  The warranty was for 24 months, or for 12 months after the gearboxes entered service.  Both contracts provided that the laws of Ontario were to apply.
In September and October of 1979 defects were discovered in the gearboxes which were repaired at a cost of $400,000.  Allis-Chambers denied responsibility due to the expired warranty.  Syncrude sued claiming a fundamental breach, but failed at trial.  The Court of Appeal found that there was a fundamental breach and that the warranty clause was not intended to exclude liability for fundamental breach, which was appealed to the Supreme Court.
Is Hunter liable for repairs to the gearboxes?
Is the exemption clause effective?
Is Allis-Chambers liable under the doctrine of fundamental breach?","Appeal of Hunter dismissed, appeal of Allis-Chalmers and cross-appeal of Syncrude allowed.","Wilson (with L'Heureux-Dubé concurring) held that a fundamental breach is a breach that deprives a party of substantially the whole benefit of the contract.  As the gearboxes in this case were repairable, this was not a fundamental breach.  She considers two options the court has:
adopt strict construction entirely (
Photo Production Ltd. v Securicor Transport Ltd.
) which would discard the concept of fundamental breach, or
adopt a reasonableness approach.
Wilson rejects the notion that the exclusion clauses would have to
per se
be fair and reasonable at formation as this would be too subjective, however the courts can easily analyze a clause after a breach has occurred to see whether the result has been unfair, allowing courts to avoid complicity in unfair bargains and balancing freedom, paternalism and fairness to find a standard of commercial reality.
She briefly addresses the doctrine of unconscionability, holding that unconscionability rests on inequality of bargaining power between the parties; there can be no unconscionability if the parties are equal.  On deciding which doctrine to apply she holds if there is a situation of unequal bargaining power, then unconscionability applies; else fundamental breach applies.
Dickson (with La Forest concurring) agrees with Wilson's outcome, but not her reasoning.  Mirroring
Photo Production
, he finds that fundamental breach is a matter of contract construction.  He points out the extreme difficulty in identifying what constitutes a fundamental breach, with different parties pointing to different sections.  He rejects Wilson's reasonableness approach unless the agreement is unconscionable, preferring to allow the parties complete freedom of contract.
The rule of law approach ignores the fact that not all exclusion clauses are unreasonable, but acknowledges that the ""price"" of the clause may be reflected in the contract price.  Further, exclusion clauses are not the only provisions that may lead to contractual unfairness.  Because of this, Dickson prefers to lay the doctrine of fundamental breach aside and focus only on the doctrine of unconscionability and the contract construction, believing this will come to the same results but by actually addressing the issues at hand.
Both parties (and McIntyre in a generally concurring judgment) agree that the parties should be held to the terms of the agreement and that Allis-Chambers is free of any liability.  Hunter was held to be liable for the repair of the gearboxes even though failure was discovered after the contractual warranty period had expired, because of a breach of implied warranty of fitness contained in
s.15(1) of the
Sale of Goods Act
.","Per Wilson:
Fundamental breach should be available as a residual regulative mechanism where:
there is equal bargaining power;
substantially the whole benefit of the contract is deprived;
there is an unfair act by the other party; and
it is determined the court wants to help by enforcing the exclusion clause.
there is equal bargaining power;
substantially the whole benefit of the contract is deprived;
there is an unfair act by the other party; and
it is determined the court wants to help by enforcing the exclusion clause.
Per Dickson:
Fundamental breach should be abandoned; the unconscionability doctrine should be used to determine if an inappropriate allocation of risk between parties should be struck down."

The father had sole interim custody after separation but then the parties entered into an informal shared custody arrangement where neither party paid support.  Three years later the mother brought an action in Alberta for retroactive and ongoing support.  The chambers judge awarded her prospective support but not retroactive.  The Court of Appeal allowed her appeal, but found no blameworthy conduct or willful failure to disclose on the part of the father.
Three children were born in the course of a common law relationship. After separation the children lived with the mother, and some months later the father paid $150 in child support pursuant to a maintenance agreement which was increased to $300/month following a consent order.  The mother brought an action for retroactive support.  The father had low income and high access costs and resisted the action.  The chambers judge held retroactive support would constitute hardship.
Parents married in 1984 and divorced in 1991. After separation the two children lived with their mother and a divorce judgment ordered the father to pay $700/month in child support.  In 2000 the mother signaled an intention to request increased support.  The father voluntarily increased his payments, but still below the table amount.  The mother was unaware that his income had increased dramatically as they lived in different cities.  At chambers, the judge granted her application for retroactive support based on the table amount, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal in a 2-1 judgment.
Parents divorced in 1996.  The children lived with the father, then one of the children moved to lived with the mother.  The father had a lot more income and the mother asked for an increase of support but the father rejected the request.  The mother was hesitant to take the case to court because earlier proceedings had caused a rift between the mother and children.  The chambers judge held that this was an appropriate circumstance for a retroactive award, and he calculated it from January 1, 2003 onward, to be paid in the amount of $500/month, as a ""reasonable compromise"" that best fit the situation of the parties.  The Court of Appeal upheld the decision.
All of these proceedings were merged before the Supreme Court.","The appeals in
DBS
and
TAR
should be allowed and the decisions of the chambers judges restored.  The appeals in
Henry
and
Hiemstra
should be dismissed.","Justice Bastarache, writing for the majority, held that children are entitled to child support from both parents commensurate with their income.  To prevent liability for retroactive support, any changes in income should be reported to the custodial parent.  If this is not done and an application is brought to enforce a change, four factors should be analysed to see if retroactive support is warranted:
Undue delay: does the recipient have a reasonable excuse for not seeking support earlier?
Any voluntary, intentional choice not to apply for an increase will militate against retroactive support.  There is a balancing here; a child should not be punished for a poor choice of the parent.
Was there blameworthy conduct on the part of the payor?
This is interpreted broadly; anything that privileges the payor's interests over his/her children's right to an appropriate amount of support.
Could the payor have reasonably believed that they were discharging their support obligations?
The more significant a change in income, the more likely a court will find a payor's behaviour blameworthy if they do not proactively disclose.
Need of child/benefit: would the child benefit from retroactive award based on their needs/circumstances?
If a child's needs are being met by the current support, this will militate against a retroactive award.
Would a retroactive award cause hardship to payor?
This is a distinct element from the
s. 10
undue hardship test.
Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.

Alternative payment arrangements, such as paying a sum over a period of time, should be considered.
Turning to how far back retroactive payments should go, it turns on the conduct of the parents.  If there was no blameworthy behaviour, the retroactivity should go to when the custodial parent informs the payor that they are seeking additional support.  Generally there will be a limit of 3 years.  For blameworthy parents, the retroactivity should continue to when the support should have changed and did not, without limit.
As to the amount of a retroactive payment, the court should follow the
Guidelines
, but the court has broad discretion to craft a remedy that would be fair having regard to all the circumstances, including hardship on the payor.
Applying this to the cases...
This was an initial application for child support.  The parents had a shared custody arrangement that thought that meant no child support was payable (see
Contino v Leonelli-Contino
).  The incomes of the parents were relatively equal and due to the shared custody any money going to one household would simply be removed from the other.  Due to the lack of blameworthy conduct and the lack of benefit to the children, no retroactive support was awarded.
The father from whom support was being sought was low income (~$23,000/year) and he was supporting a second family.  Any retroactive award would cause his household hardship.  The access costs for him were also high.  Because of the lack of blameworthy conduct, the hardship a retroactive award would cause, and the fact that the standard of living in the custodial household was higher, no retroactive support was awarded.
In this case, the mother had broached the subject with the father but could not afford a lawyer to fight the case.  She was intimidated by her ex-husband and did not know much about his financial situation as he lived in another city.  The husband had had a huge income increase and held it from her, as well as saying that she should have managed her money better to better provide for their kids and that he was paying all he could afford.  Due to the large amount of blameworthy conduct and the large discrepancy in the amount he was paying and the table amount, the court awarded $100,000 in retroactive support.
As in
Henry
, the parties had very different incomes; the father earned more than $100,000K/year, much more than the mother, and he gave no financial support when the need arose.  The mother said she had not wanted to litigate because of the effect it had had on her daughter the last time they litigated.  The court held that the delay of mother was not unreasonable, and the father had no reasonable grounds on which to believe the level of support he was paying was reasonable, and thus the award granted at trial was upheld.
Abella, dissenting in part, had three issues with the decision of Bastarache.
The presumptive starting date of effective notice: the payor has the information on when their income changes, so it is impractical and unrealistic to expect the recipient to keep tabs on the payor’s income; the date should be when the income changes.
The role of blameworthy conduct: the conduct of the payor should be immaterial; the whole obligation depends on the income increase, conduct of the parties is irrelevant.
The three year cutoff: Abella finds this arbitrary - any cutoff of this type should be found in statute, not created by the courts.","Retroactive child support orders should no longer be rare or difficult to obtain.
Established the framework for assessing claims where there is a large, undisclosed swing in income.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?
Children are entitled to support from both parents commensurate with their ability to pay.
Can the payor say that they reasonably believed they were discharging their child support obligation?
This case is sometimes referred to as the ""don't-ask-don't-tell"" case, as the
Federal Child Support Guidelines
do not require payors to update their income information each year, merely that the paying parent make disclosure at least once a year upon request of recipient parent (

Human Rights Act

This was the basis of the Court of Appeal decision; these services were not offered to the general public and thus there was no protected activity violated.
The Supreme Court held that it is really the nature of the relationship that must be public.  Here it is between an institution and an individual – this is a public relationship (even the professor is acting as an agent of UBC).  The majority make it very clear that subsections of the public do not matter when determining if it is a service offered to the public; all that matters is if the nature of the relationship between the parties is public.

At the time he had been an employee of BC Rail for around 25 years and as he was off work for 20 weeks he had collected disability benefits pursuant to a collective agreement. No deductions were made from his pay for those benefits, but the hourly wage package was made up of an hourly rate of pay together with collateral benefits. Disability benefits recovered did not have to be paid either to the employer or to the insurance company managing the plan. The trial judge held that the payments should not be deducted in calculating the amount payable by the Wheelers for the wages lost by Cunningham as a result of his injuries, as he had established that the indemnity benefits were paid for by him as part of his wage package. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment, determining that since there was no subrogation right in the employer, and the direct funding for the disability benefits came from the employer, the plan was not in the nature of a private insurance policy and the funds received should be deducted from the damage award.",Appeal allowed.,"Cory, writing for the majority, held that while a plaintiff in a tort action was not generally entitled to a double recovery for any loss arising from the injury, the disability benefits obtained by Cunningham as a result of his collective bargaining agreement were in the nature of a private policy of insurance and should not be deducted from the claim for lost wages. To show that the benefits were in the nature of insurance, there must be evidence adduced of some type of consideration given up by the employee in return for the benefit. Since the benefits at issue here were bargained for and obtained as a result of a reduction in the hourly rate of pay, they were obtained and paid for by Cunningham just as much as if he had bought and privately paid for a disability insurance policy. The application of the insurance exception to benefits received under a contract of employment should not be limited to cases where the plaintiff was a member of a union and bargained collectively. Benefits received under the employment contracts of non-unionized employees would also be non-deductible if proof was provided of payment in some manner by the employee for the benefits. Evidence that the employer took the cost of benefits into account in determining wages would adequately establish that the employee contributed by way of a trade-off against higher wages.","If payments received as part of an insurance package were paid for in some manner by the injured party (either directly, or in some manner of reduced wages, etc.) then they should not be deducted from the calculation of lost wages when assessing damages."

At the time they were dismissed Machtinger was credit manager and rust‑proofing sales manager and Lefebvre was sales manager.  Each had entered into a contract for employment for an indefinite period which contained a clause allowing the respondent to terminate his employment without cause, in Machtinger's case without notice and in Lefebvre's case on two weeks' notice.  Under the provincial
Employment Standards Act
the appellants were entitled to a minimum notice period of four weeks.  After they were dismissed, the respondent paid each of them the equivalent of four weeks' salary.  The appellants brought action for wrongful dismissal and the trial judge found that they were entitled to reasonable notice of termination, and that the period of reasonable notice for Machtinger was 7 months and for Lefebvre, 7½ months, however this was overturned by the Court of Appeal.","Appeal allowed, lower court judgment restored.","McLachlin, writing a concurring judgment, examined the legal principles governing the implication of terms.  She identifies three types of implied terms:
terms implied by fact (intention required);
terms implied by law (no intention required); and
terms implied by custom and usage,
and identifies #2 as the type the courts will read into a contract.  Implication of law can be from custom, for business efficiency (what is necessary in a contract), or what is reasonable (from Denning's dissent in
Liverpool City Council v Irwin
).
She finds that the Court of Appeal erred in characterizing a term implied in law as a term implied in fact, which brought in the intentionality of the parties.  Holding that the employer had a legal obligation to provide reasonable notice and that this can only be displaced by an express contrary agreement, the court imposed a reasonable term of notification on HOJ; HOJ industries.","Terms can be implied by the court based on:
custom or usage;
if necessary for business efficacy;

He was let go during his probationary period and not given any prior notice of his termination or provided with any reasons for the decision.  There was a section in the governing
Police Act
(now replaced by the
Police Services Act
) that required the Commission to provide a hearing for dismissal where the officer was employed for more than 18 months, however Nicholson was let go prior to the end of his 18 month probation.  Nicholson argued that despite the timeframe he was still entitled to at least some procedural fairness.",Appeal allowed.,"Chief Justice Laskin writes that although Nicholson is clearly not entitled to the same amount of procedure that an officer employed for more than 18 months is entitled to, he must still be treated fairly and not arbitrarily.  Laskin states that in the sphere of administrative law there is a ""general duty of fairness"" owed to claimants.  He says that this is grounded in the idea that differentiating between judicial and administrative decisions is very difficult and it does not make any sense to give some people full procedural protection while the others get nothing at all.  Therefore in this case he believes that the minimal required protection means that Nicholson should have at least been given reasons for his dismissal.
Martland, in the dissent, disagrees and argues that the statutory language is clear: if you are not employed for 18 months, then the Commission may terminate your employment without any reasons.  This is exactly what happened in this case, which he argues was within the legislature's intent and should not be disturbed.","There is a general common law duty of fairness that always applies in administrative decisions, even where there is a procedural guarantee which does not apply in a given case."

Bill of Rights
provide for procedural fairness in a legislative context?","The respondent was named representative plaintiff of a class of disabled veterans who received pensions and other benefits from the Crown under three different statutes. These funds were administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (""DVA"") because the veterans were deemed incapable of managing their money. These funds were rarely invested or credited with interest until 1990, when the DVA began paying interest on the accounts. But Parliament chose to limit the Crown's liability for past interest by enacting s. 5.1(4) of the Department of Veterans Affairs Act which provides that no claim shall be made after the coming into force of the provision for or on account of interest on moneys held or administered by the Minister during any period prior to January 1, [page41] 1990 pursuant to any of the three relevant statutes. The class sued the Crown, alleging breach of fiduciary duty and claiming that the s. 5.1(4) bar was inoperative under the Canadian Bill of Rights, because it was inconsistent with the right not to be deprived of the enjoyment of property except by due process of law (s. 1(a)) and the right to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice for the determination of one's rights and obligations (s. 2(e)).
The federal government failed to properly invest pensions of disabled war veterans. Parliament chose to limit the Crown's liability for past interest by enacting s. 5.1(4) of the
Department of Veterans Affairs Act
, which provided that no claim shall be made after the coming into force of the provision for or on account of interest on moneys held or administered by the Minister during any period prior to January 1, 1990 pursuant to any of the three relevant statutes. Authorson argued that the legislation was inoperative as it infringed the right not to be deprived of the enjoyment of property except by due process of law under
s. 1(a) of the
Canadian Bill of Rights
, as well as the right to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice for the determination of one's rights and obligations under
s. 2(e)
.
The trial judge held that the Crown owed a fiduciary duty to the disabled veterans, and so was obliged to either invest the funds on their behalf, or pay interest, and that s. 5.1(4) of the
Act
was inoperative under the Bill of Rights. The Court of Appeal upheld the decision, which the Crown appealed.",Appeal allowed.,"Major, writing for a unanimous court, held that the
Act
was not inconsistent with the
Bill of Rights
.  The due process protections in
s. 1(a)
do not require that the veterans receive notice and a hearing before Parliament prior to the passage of expropriative legislation. He states:
The only procedure due any citizen of Canada is that proposed legislation receive three readings in the Senate and House of Commons and that it receive Royal Assent. Once that process is completed, legislation within Parliament's competence is unassailable.
Due process protections cannot interfere with the right of the legislative branch to determine its own procedure. No adjudicative procedure is necessary for the non-discretionary application of a law to incontestable facts. Finally, while substantive rights may stem from due process, the Bill of Rights does not protect against the expropriation of property by the passage of unambiguous legislation. Parliament has the right to expropriate property, even without compensation, if it has made its intention clear and, in s. 5.1(4), Parliament's expropriative intent is clear and unambiguous.","The quasi-constitutional norms in the
Bill of Rights
are of no assistance in legislative decision making; legislative decisions are exempt from the common law duty of fairness."

Jackson Limited and operated by Stuart Galloway.  The children were served at a service window of the truck on the curbside.  Diane was served first and while her brother was being served she left to return to the opposite side of the street.  After passing around the front of the truck, she was struck by a car owned by Wallace Arnold and driven by Brian Arnold.  As a result of the injuries sustained by Diane her mobility was seriously lessened, although technically she was not paralysed, and she suffered a considerable degree of mental impairment.
The trial judge gave judgment against the four defendants apportioning the negligence between them: 1/3 against the Arnolds; 1/3 against Jackson and Galloway, and 1/3 against Jackson alone.  The Court of Appeal varied the apportionment of negligence to 1/4 for the Arnolds, 1/4 for Jackson, 1/4 for Galloway, and 1/4 for Yvonne Teno, the mother.  The trial judge assessed the total damages of Diane at $950,000 divided into two parts: $200,000 for non-pecuniary damages and $750,000 for pecuniary damages.  The Court of Appeal reduced the award for pecuniary general damages by $75,000, but otherwise did not interfere with the assessment of damages at trial.","Appeal's decision was overturned. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Mrs. Teno could not be blamed for the accident. All other defendants found liable; damages fixed at $540,000.","The lower court had decided to use the yearly salary of the little girl's mother ($10,000/year) in the absence of any other guide.  The court held that this cannot be used because they cannot rely merely upon speculation.  They say that an award of $5,000 yearly would be too low as it would place her below the poverty line.  As a result they split the difference and award lost earnings of $7,500/year and use a discount rate of 7% in assessing the total.",

When the boy was 1, his mother took off with him searching for her biological father and found him in Vancouver. After some issues, Children's Aid apprehended the boy and placed him with his biological grandfather, an Aboriginal.  The adoptive parents of the mother (a white couple living in Connecticut) contested custody, while the mother supported the grandfather's application.
The trial judge granted the custody application, but this was overturned by the Court of Appeal.",Appeal allowed; decision of trial judge restored.,"No written reasons were given by the Supreme Court, simply an oral judgment restoring the order of the trial judge.  This outcome is inconsistent with previous case law, awarding custody to the adoptive grandparents despite psychological bonding with the biological grandfather (who he had spent three of his four years with) and the shared culture.
The trial court had considered:
bonding;
the child has both Aboriginal and Afro-American heritage;
the Connecticut couple might be better suited to reconnect child with Afro-American heritage.
the wishes of the mother;
the current residence of the child with the grandfather; and
the best parenting and family environment (mainly material values).
the grandfather's means were not as good as the Connecticut couple.
the Connecticut couple might be better suited to reconnect child with Afro-American heritage.
the grandfather's means were not as good as the Connecticut couple.
On balance, it appears the court gave the child to the adoptive grandparents as they could offer a more stable upbringing and more economic advantages.",Race and culture are merely one consideration when determining the best interests of the child.
Cook v Lewis,"Cook v Lewis, [1951] SCR 830",,Robert Lewis,1951,Supreme Court of Canada,"Rand, Estey, Locke, Cartwright, and Fauteux JJ",Canada,,,"When there are two parties, and it is proven that one of their actions caused harm, but it cannot be proven which one it was, who, if anyone, is liable?","All of the parties were hunting. Lewis was hiding in a bush, and his brother tried to warn Cook and his companions of this but it was misunderstood. A few grouses flew out of the bush, and Cook and his companions fired shots. Lewis was hit in the face, and lost an eye. Cook and his companions gave statements claiming that they could not have shot Lewis. The jury found that it was one of their shots that hit him, but they could not decide whose shot it was. The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial, which Cook appealed.",Appeal dismissed.,"The decision in the lower court was based upon the general Canadian rule that stated that when it is certain that one of two individuals committed the offence, but it is uncertain which one was the guilty agent, then neither of them can be convicted.
Cartwright, writing for the majority, decides not to follow this and to follow US precedent instead, from
Summers v Tice
and
Oliver v Miles
, which state that to allow both parties to escape liability is unfair because both of them were negligent.  Lewis is put in an unfair position in having to prove which of the parties did it, and will not recover because of this unfair position.  He agrees with this, and states that both parties must be held liable, as they were both negligent in firing their shots.
Rand concurs, but goes further to say that this burden is so unfair on Lewis that the burden must shift to the appellants to prove which one of them did it.  If neither has proof then they are both equally liable, however the onus is on each appellant to prove that the other is the guilty party.  This is fairer because the appellants have a better idea of what really happened than Lewis.
In the dissent, Locke says that the relationship between the two appellants is not close enough to make them share liability for each other's actions.  The simple fact that they were hunting together, and were going to split the kill at the end of the day does not mean that they should be completely responsible for each other’s actions.","There is no joint tortfeasance when two parties are engaged in a lawful common enterprise, and it is proven that one of them caused harm in their actions but it cannot be proven which party actually did it, unless there are special circumstances of agency in the parties' relationship (e.g. master and servant, employer and employee, principal and agent), in which case both parties may be found liable for the resulting damages; i.e., found to be joint tortfeasors."
Homex Realty and Development Co. Ltd. v Wyoming (Village),"Homex Realty and Development Co. Ltd. v Wyoming (Village), [1980] 2 SCR 1011",Homex Realty and Development Company Limited,The Corporation of the Village of Wyoming,1980,Supreme Court of Canada,"Laskin CJ and Martland, Ritchie, Dickson, Beetz, Estey and Chouinard JJ",Canada,,,"What qualifies as a ""legislative"" decision such that no duty of procedural fairness applies?","As a condition of registration of a plan of subdivision in the Village of Wyoming, Atkinson, the owner and subdivider of the parcel of land, entered into an agreement with the Village for the installation of municipal services in the subdivision. This agreement, dated January 22, 1968, and registered September 26, 1975, provided in a general way for the owner's providing ""all the requirements financial and otherwise, of the Corporation re surfacing of roads, installation of services and drainage"". The agreement also prevented the sale of the lands in question until the agreement had been fully carried out, except with the consent of the Village, but the provision did not provide that consent would operate to release Atkinson from his obligation to the Village. Before any services were installed, Homex bought the great majority of the lots on the subdivision with the Village's consent. There was some question as to whether or not Homex had undertaken to assume the obligations of the original subdivider. Nevertheless, when protracted negotiations between the Village and Homex concerning the installation of services proved fruitless, the Village, in April 1976, pursuant to s. 29(3) (now
s. 50(3)
) of the
Planning Act
and without notice to Homex, enacted by-law 7 deeming the lots purchased by Homex not to be a registered plan of subdivision. Homex, in September 1976, made application for judicial review for an order quashing by-law 7 and, while the application was pending, checkerboarded its lots.
In November 1975, Homex and the Village negotiated the installation of services along the only street requiring them. By-law 6, enacted in December 1975, provided that it was the policy of the Village that it would neither assume responsibility for a water pipeline constructed by Homex nor permit its connection to the municipal water supply system. Homex coupled an application in judicial review to quash by-law 6 with the application for an order to quash by-law 7.",Appeal dismissed.,"Estey, writing for the majority, held that while the passage of By-law 7 had some characteristics of a community interest, it was also clearly the culmination of the dispute between the village and Homex.  As a result he found that the decision was quasi-judicial such as to attract the principle of notice and the doctrine of
audi alteram partem
.  Despite this, however, he held that the conduct of Homex to rid itself of the obligations under the agreement with Atkinson were such that it should be denied a discretionary remedy.  There was also no basis to challenge By-law 6 as it simply stated the facts of the agreement with Atkinson.
Dickson, in the dissent, is quoted:
The courts long ago developed the general proposition that wherever a statute authorizes the interference with property or other rights and is silent as to whether or not the agency in question is required to give notice prior to the intervention in such rights, the courts will ""supply the omission of the legislature"" and require the agency in question to afford the subject an opportunity of being heard before it proceeds.
He held that an act could not be labelled ""legislative"" merely for the purpose of dispensing with fairness. It was not particularly important that the function of the municipality was classified as ""legislative"" or ""quasi-judicial"", rather, it was necessary to look at the nature of the function and to the facts of each case. The by-law in question was not of wide and general application, but was rather aimed at deliberately limiting the rights of Homex, entitling it to some procedural safeguards - at a minimum, notice of the proposed by-law and the opportunity to be heard.","In general, the courts have not imposed procedural requirements on the subordinate law-making function.
The facts of each case are key to determining the level of procedural fairness required."

Zofia had been a house-wife for the duration of the marriage and experienced many difficulties in finding work once separated. She worked at a hotel as a maid but eventually lost her job. Andrzej paid child and spousal support at the time, but once Zofia lost her job, she applied to have an increase in spousal support. When Zofia found another job, Andrzej submitted an application to have the support cut-off. The trial judge found that the former wife had had time to become financially independent and that her husband had supported her as long as he could be required to do.  The Court of Appeal set aside the judgment and ordered spousal support in the amount of $150/month for an indefinite period, which the husband appealed.",Appeal dismissed,"L'Heureux-Dubé, writing for the majority, said marriage should be thought of as a joint venture, and if economic consequences fall disproportionately on one spouse, spousal support can redress the balance.  While spouses would still have an obligation after the marriage breakdown to contribute to their own support in a manner commensurate with their abilities, the ultimate goal is to alleviate the disadvantaged spouse's economic losses as completely as possible, taking into account all the circumstances of the parties, including the advantages conferred on the other spouse during the marriage, i.e. the notion of compensatory support.
She analyzes the four objectives in
s. 17(7) of the
Divorce Act
:
Economic disadvan
Apportionment of financial consequences of care of the children
Economic hardship resulting from the breakdown of the marriage
Promotion of self-sufficiency of the parties within a reasonable timeframe following the breakdown of the marriage
Self-sufficiency is not attained simply by a finding full-time employment at minimum wage; the recipient’s employment and earnings must be at least somewhat related to the marital standard of living and that enjoyed by the payor’s spouse
Self-sufficiency is not attained simply by a finding full-time employment at minimum wage; the recipient’s employment and earnings must be at least somewhat related to the marital standard of living and that enjoyed by the payor’s spouse

There should be an equitable distribution of the disadvantages or other economic consequences of marriage upon marriage breakdown.

He had a history of heavy drinking and had had 12 beers to drink (blood alcohol of 0.225) and left to drive home.

He drove away with two passengers and collided with a car head-on, killing one of the other car's passengers and severely injuring Ms. Childs, a teenager.  Ms. Childs' spine was severed, and she was paralyzed from the waist down.  Mr. Desormeaux pled guilty in court and was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.  Ms. Childs is now suing the hosts of the party and saying that they are liable for the injuries.",Appeal dismissed.,"McLachlin, writing for a unanimous court, states that there is no duty of care owed by the hosts to potential victims of the inebriated guest's actions.  Using the framework of
Cooper v Hobart
, McLachlin states that this test should be compared with similar cases to see if it falls into an existing area of law, or if it is a novel case.  She compares it with the situation of commercial alcohol providers, who have been found to be liable to third-party members of the public who are injured as a result of the drunken driving of a customer.  However, there are three main reasons why this case can be distinguished from cases involving commercial hosts.  First, commercial hosts have direct control over the alcohol consumption of their patrons.  Second, there are very strict legislative rules governing commercial hosts, while no such laws exist for private parties.  Finally, there is a contractual relationship between commercial hosts and their patrons – this is fundamentally different from the range of relationships that characterize private parties.  Therefore, as this is a novel case, it must be put through the two stage
Anns
test to determine if a duty is owed.
The first step of the test is whether or not the two parties are proximate enough for a duty to be established – it must be foreseeable that the defendant’s actions could cause harm to the plaintiff.  McLachlin concludes that there was not foreseeability in this case – it was found as a fact that the hosts did not know that Mr. Desormeaux was too drunk to drive, and simply knowing that he had a drinking problem does not means that they were liable for the consequences of his driving.
McLachlin then examines nonfeasance.  She says that foreseeability is not the only hurdle that Ms. Childs' case has to jump in order to establish a duty.  When the conduct alleged against the defendant is a failure to act, then foreseeability alone cannot establish a duty of care.  The plaintiff tries to argue that by organizing the party, the hosts created a risky situation and therefore their failure to act thereafter does not protect them from liability.  Although this would be true if it were the case, McLachlin finds that the hosts did not create a ""risky situation"" and therefore their failure to act was merely nonfeasance.  She also goes on to say that positive duties of care exist in situations of paternalistic relationships, and when a defendant is exercising a public function that includes liability to the public at large – but neither of these apply to the case at bar.  Overall, she says that it is only when third parties have a special relationship with the party in danger or a material role in managing the risk that the law may impinge on their autonomy and demand a positive duty of care.
McLachlin concludes that partygoers do not check their autonomy at the door of the party – they remain responsible for their own actions.  Unless the partygoers are reasonably relying on the hosts for their safety (such as a party on a boat, etc.), the partygoers are solely responsible for the outcomes of their own actions.  She does not need to consider the second step of the
Anns
test (public policy) because there was no foreseeability established here, and therefore no duty was owed.
Social Host liability does not exist in Canada: A social host at a party where alcohol is served is not under a duty of care to members of the public who may be injured by a guest's actions, unless the host’s conduct implicates him or her in the creation or exacerbation of the risk....",
O'Malley v Simpsons-Sears,"O'Malley v Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 SCR 536",,Simpsons-Sears Ltd.,1985,Supreme Court of Canada,,Canada,,,How do you deal with adverse effect discrimination?,"O'Malley had worked for Sears for about seven years and had always worked on Fridays and Saturdays.  She became a Seventh Day Adventist, which meant that she was not allowed to work from sundown on Friday to sunup on Sunday.","Appeal allowed with costs, awarded the difference between her part-time wage and the amount she would have earned working full-time.","The court recognizes that there is discrimination but that it cannot be dealt with in the same manner as direct discrimination (as in
Ontario Human Rights Commission et al. v The Borough of Etobicoke
) as the rule itself (making employees work weekends) is not discriminatory – it is neutral.  However, it creates discriminatory effects inadvertently for the claimant.  Therefore, they don't want to strike out the rule, they simply want to accommodate the individual within the rule.  The court develops a two-step test that can be used to determine whether the adverse discrimination is really a bona fide occupational requirement and therefore permitted:
is the rule/standard rationally connected to the necessities of the job?
have they accommodated the individual to the point of undue hardship?
Similar to the direct discrimination test the onus is first on the claimant to prove a
prima facie
case of discrimination and then it switches to the respondent to pass the two-part test.  All of the onuses are on a balance of probabilities.
Although the court does not provide an exhaustive list of what undue hardship includes, they state that some things (health, safety, costs) are always taken into consideration.  Also, they say that accommodating to the point that someone gets to ignore a bona fide occupational requirement is obviously undue hardship.  In this case Sears could pass the first part of the test, but not the second part as they could have given her a different schedule without weekend shifts.","The
O'Malley
test should be used for determining if there is a bona fide occupational requirement in cases of adverse effect discrimination before the establishment of the

Canada Pension Plan
benefits from the death of her former common law spouse.  They had lived together for many years, but had broken up for approximately five months prior to his death.  Separated married couples would receive benefits if one spouse died, but divorced couples would not.  Hodge was successful in the lower courts which the government appealed.",Appeal allowed.,"Binnie, writing for a unanimous court, allows the appeal.  He finds that the lower court erred in law when they accepted Hodge's statement that the correct comparator group was separated married spouses.  The Supreme Court rejects this as they state that separated married spouses are still ""spouses"" because their legal relationship still exists, whereas non-cohabitating common law spouses are no longer ""spouses"" in the eyes of the law as they have no legal relations.  She was not in any form of relationship with the deceased at the time of his death, which is the relevant time according to the legislation.  Therefore she was not denied the benefits because she was a common law spouse rather than a married spouse, but because she was not a spouse at all.
Hodge claimed that separated common law spouses should remain ""spouses"" if they continue to be economically dependent on the other person after separation.  However Binnie rejected this, and said that the legislatures defined cohabitation and not economic dependency as the measure for common law spouses.
In the result, as Hodge is not a member of the relevant comparator group (divorced legal spouses) she cannot establish discrimination under
s.15
on the grounds of marital status.","If one cannot establish that the relevant comparator group would receive the benefits that you have not received, then they cannot bring a successful
s.15
discrimination claim.
The courts can change the comparator group brought forward by the claimant if they do not think that it is the correct one.
If you cannot prove the relevant comparator group receives the benefits, then you cannot succeed."

However, as none of these apply, Law would have to wait until she is 65 to receive her benefits.  She is saying that these provisions violate her
s.15
Charter

s.15
.  He establishes the purpose of the section and how to determine whether or not discrimination has occurred.  He says first that
s.15(1)
must always be given a purposive interpretation and be viewed in the entire context of the situation.  Then he says that in order to establish a violation of
s.15
you must satisfy the three-part test:
differential treatment (need a comparator group) . . .
on the basis of an enumerated or analogous ground, and
the law has a purpose or effect that is discriminatory.
In determining if the effect is ""discriminatory"" in the third step, the court must consider:
Does the law draw a distinction:
between the claimant and other on the basis of stereotypical personal characteristics, or;
fail to take into account the claimant's disadvantaged position?
Is this differential treatment based on an enumerated or analogous ground?
Does this discriminate by imposing a burden or withholding a benefit?
between the claimant and other on the basis of stereotypical personal characteristics, or;
fail to take into account the claimant's disadvantaged position?
He says that the purpose of
s.15(1)
is ""to prevent the violation of essential human dignity . . . and to promote a society in which all persons enjoy equal recognition under the law as human beings"".  It is essential to find a conflict between the impugned law and the purpose of
s.15(1)
in order to found a discrimination claim.
He goes on to say that the equality guarantee is a comparative concept, and that you must establish a comparator group that is not discriminated against, and is similar to the claimant in most ways except for the ground cited.  The claimant, or the court may establish this.
The violation of dignity must be done in context – from the perspective of the claimant.  It must be determined if a reasonable person in the same position would feel that their human dignity had been violated.  Some important things to consider here (not necessary, help ground a claim) are:
pre-existing disadvantage
correspondence between the ground and the actual needs of the claimant
ameliorative purpose of the law
the nature and scope of the interest affected by the impugned law
A claimant never has to prove any of these things, and a decision about discrimination can be completely drawn by the court through logical inferences if necessary.  However, it may be helpful for the claimant to examine some of the factors listed above.
In the case at bar, it is clear that there is a distinction drawn on the enumerated ground of age, however the court finds that there is no discrimination.  Several factors contribute to this: younger people are not a disadvantaged group; there is no need of the claimant here as she can find work, and the law has a very ameliorative purpose.  Therefore, this is one of the few cases where there has been a distinction drawn on the basis of an enumerated ground, however this distinction does not create ""discrimination"".  Therefore, this is not a violation of the equal benefits provided by
s.15(1)
.","In order to establish a violation of

If he performed this, then the respondent would not sue.  Both parties signed this agreement on July 17, 1958.  Foot followed this agreement, however after cashing the November 1960 cheque an action was brought for the balance.",Appeal is allowed; the new agreement may continue and the respondent cannot sue unless the appellant fails to keep up the payments.,After a careful review of the case law the judge decides that the respondent relinquished his right to sue when he entered into the substitute agreement.  The consideration in the agreement was the appellant's agreement to provide the post dated cheques in advance purely for the benefit of the respondent so that he could enjoy the money before his death.,"Accepting terms that benefit the creditor for convenience can amount to consideration.

S. 42 of the Barristers and Solicitors Act in BC forbids non-citizens from practicing law in BC. Andrews had obtained a law degree from Oxford, and met all requirements to the BC bar except that of Canadian citizenship.
Andrews sued on the basis that s. 42 violated his rights under s. 15(1) of the Charter. The case was dismissed at trial, but Andrews succeeded on appeal to the BC Court of Appeals. The Law Society of British Columbia then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.","Appeal dismissed. s. 42 violates s. 15, and is not saved by s.1.","The Court rejected the approach previously applied under the Canadian Bill of Rights, which required that ""similarly situated should be similarly treated"", because this allowed differently situated people to be treated discriminatorily.
The Court defined discrimination as a distinction, whether intentional or not, that has the effect of imposing burdens, obligations, or disadvantages on an individual or group not imposed upon others, or withholding or limiting access to opportunities, benefits, and advantages available to other members of society. S. 42 discriminated by limiting the employment opportunities of people qualified to be lawyers, on the basis of citizenship.
Further, the list of enumerated grounds in s. 15(1) is not exhaustive. Discrimination based on grounds analogous to the enumerated grounds is similarly forbidden. Non-citizens lack political power and are therefore vulnerable and disadvantaged, similar to some of the enumerated groups described in S. 15(1).
Therefore, s. 42 violates s. 15 of the Charter.
Lastly, s. 42 is not saved by s. 1 of the Charter. Citizenship does not ensure a lawyer's familiarity with Canadian institutions and customs, nor their commitment to Canadian society. Lack of citizenship similarly does not necessarily mean lack of familiarity nor commitment. Following the Oakes test, the Court found that the provisions of s. 42 are not carefully tailored to achieve any pressing and substantial objective.",The test for discrimination under S. 15(1) asks: (1) Is there differential treatment based on an enumerated or analogous ground?

Just v British Columbia,"Just v British Columbia(1989), 64 DLR (4th) 689",John Just,Her Majesty the Queen in Right of the Province of British Columbia,1989,Supreme Court of Canada,"Dickson CJ and Cory, Wilson, La Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier, and Sopinka JJ",Canada,,,"Is the government under a duty of care to maintain the highways and if so, are they liable if the highways are not sufficiently maintained?","Heavy snow fall forced Just and his daughter to stop in a line of traffic by a rocky slope on a major highway.  A boulder, which worked loose from the wooded slopes above the highway, came crashing down on the appellant's car, killing the appellant's daughter and causing him very serious injuries.  Just brought an action against the provincial government contending that the government negligently failed to properly maintain the highway.
The Department of Highways had set up a system for inspection and remedial work upon rock slopes.  Inspection and recommendations were made by engineers and the work was effected by a rock scaling crew responsible for performing remedial work throughout the entire province.  The department's practice had been to make visual inspections from the highway unless rock falls or a history of instability in an area indicated a need for the rock engineer to climb the slope.  Numerous informal inspections were carried out by highway personnel as they drove along the road.
The trial judge found that the entire system of inspection and the way it was implemented was a policy matter which did not give rise to liability. No finding was made as to whether or not the system of inspection was reasonable or whether the inspections themselves were properly carried out. The Court of Appeal upheld the finding of the trial judge and Just appealled to the Supreme Court.","Appeal allowed, new trial ordered.","Cory, writing for the majority, held that the province owes a duty of care, which ordinarily extends to their reasonable maintenance, to those using its highways.  The Department of Highways could readily foresee the risk that harm might befall users of a highway if it were not reasonably maintained.  That maintenance could be found to extend to the prevention of injury from falling rock.
Government agencies may be exempt from the application of the traditional tort law duty of care if an explicit statutory exemption exists or if the decision arose as a result of a policy decision.  Whether or not a decision is characterized as a policy decision or as an operational decision rests on the nature of the decision and not on the identity of the actors.  Generally, decisions concerning budgetary allotments for departments or government agencies should be classified as policy decisions.  A policy decision may be open to challenge on the basis that it is not made in the bona fide exercise of discretion.  If after due consideration it is found that a duty of care is owed by the government agency and no exemption by way of statute or policy decision-making is found to exist, a traditional torts analysis ensues (as per
Anns v Merton London Borough Council
) and the issue of standard of care required of the government agency must next be considered.  The manner and quality of an inspection system, since it was clearly part of the operational aspect of a governmental activity, should be assessed when consideration is given to the standard of care issue.  At this stage, the requisite standard of care must be assessed in light of all the surrounding circumstances including budgetary restraints and the availability of qualified personnel and equipment.
Sopinka, in the dissent, held that the government had the power to carry out the inspections but was under no duty to do so.  Conduct within the limits of this discretion gives rise to no duty of care; conduct outside of these limits may attract a private law duty of care.
A litigant may not attack a policy and it is not appropriate for a Court to pass on it, absent evidence that a policy was adopted for some ulterior motive and not for a municipal purpose.  In order for a private duty to arise, it would have to be shown that the Rockwork Section acted outside its delegated discretion to determine whether to inspect and the manner in which the inspection is to be made.  Policy decisions are immune from review because they usually entail not only a decision to do something but also some call upon the public purse.  The government was acting within its discretion when it decided that inspections should be done and the manner in which they were to be done.  Responsibility for deciding the extent to which the inspection program was to be implemented was delegated to the Rockwork Section.","The duty of care should apply to a public authority unless there is a valid basis for its exclusion.
Policy decisions – the decision by the government about what acts to perform under a given statute – are exempt from liability; operational decisions – the decision by the government about how to perform those acts once they have been decided - are not exempt from liability."
Mount Sinai Hospital Center v Quebec (Minister of Health and Social Services),"Mount Sinai Hospital Center v Quebec (Minister of Health and Social Services), 2001 SCC 41",Minister of Health and Social Services,,2001,Supreme Court of Canada,"McLachlin CJ and L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier, Iacobucci, Major, Bastarache and Binnie JJ",Canada,,,Should the promised permit be issued to the hospital?,"The Mount Sinai Hospital Center was originally established as a long-term treatment facility dealing primarily with patients suffering from tuberculosis. During the 1950s, the Center began to introduce new programs and services and developed a general respiratory expertise in a setting with both long-term and short-term care facilities. This change in services was known to the government which throughout funded all of the Center's activities. In 1984, negotiations between the Center and the Ministry of Health and Social Services to move the Center to Montreal began. At that time, the Center was operating under its original permit for 107 long-term care beds even though it had for 10 years been providing 57 long-term care beds and 50 intermediary or short-term care beds. The Center wanted its permit altered to reflect the reality of the services it offered. The Minister promised the Center that it would formally alter the permit once the Center moved to Montreal. The promise to issue the correct permit was reaffirmed on various occasions. Once the Center had moved to Montreal, in January 1991, it made a formal request to the Minister for a regularization of the permit. Without giving the Center an opportunity to make submissions on the issue, in October 1991, the Minister informed the Center that it would not receive the promised permit and would have to operate under the old unaltered permit. This was despite the fact that the services being offered still included short-term services funded by the government. The Center brought an action in
mandamus
before the Superior Court, requesting that the court order the Minister to issue the promised permit.
Relying on the legitimate expectation created by the Minister's conduct, the Superior Court allowed the
mandamus
application in part and ordered that the Minister hear the Center's submissions before deciding whether the alteration of the permit was in the public interest. The Court of Appeal allowed the Center's appeal and ordered the Minister to issue the promised permit, applying the doctrine of public law promissory estoppel.",Appeal dismissed.,"The majority decided the case based on the Minister's failure to extend even minimal procedural fairness to the Center, which should thus result in the setting aside of his decision to refuse the application for a modified permit; the Center had no notice that the Minister was about to reverse his position, or the reasons for reversal, and no opportunity to present argument as to why the Minister's earlier and long-standing view that the public interest favoured a modified Center should prevail.  However, in a concurring decision, Justice Binnie, with McLachlin CJ concurring, dealt with the issues of estoppel and legitimate expectations in this case.  The respondents had argued for an expansion of legitimate expectations from that of
Reference re Canada Assistance Plan
to include substantive outcomes.  Binnie held that availability and content of procedural fairness are generally driven by the nature of the applicant's interest and the nature of the power exercised by the public authority in relation to that interest.  The doctrine of legitimate expectations, on the other hand, looks to the conduct of the public authority in the exercise of that power including established practices, conduct or representations that can be characterized as clear, unambiguous and unqualified. The expectations must not conflict with the public authority's statutory remit.   He acknowledged that in some cases it is difficult to distinguish the procedural from the substantive, but upheld the distinction on the basis of the underlying principle that broad public policy is preeminently for the Minister to determine, not the courts. He did clarify that a person seeking review on the basis of legitimate expectations may show, but does not necessarily have to show, detrimental reliance on the expectations.  On the facts of this case, the doctrine of legitimate expectations does not add to the relief otherwise available under the ordinary rules of procedural fairness, and thus the requested expansion was not warranted.
However, Binnie stated that estoppel may be available to give substantive relief against a public authority, including a Minister, in narrow circumstances. The requirements of estoppel go well beyond the requirements of the doctrine of legitimate expectations. All the elements of private law promissory estoppel are present in this case. However, public law promissory estoppel requires an additional appreciation of the legislative intent embodied in the power whose exercise is sought to be estopped. Circumstances that might otherwise create an estoppel may have to yield to an overriding public interest expressed in the legislative text. The wording of the particular statutory power in question and the status of who wields it is important. In the case at bar, the statute mandated the Minister to act in the public interest in very broad terms, and if the public interest as he defines it is opposed to the award of the modified permit, then a court should not estop the Minister from doing what he considers his duty.  Binnie thus concludes that on the facts, estoppel was not available as applied by the Quebec Court of Appeal.","Expansion of the legitimate expectations doctrine into substantive outcomes is not warranted in the public context, as it would supercede the principle that public policy is for the executive branch to decide, not the courts.
A party seeking review on the basis of legitimate expectations does not have to show detrimental reliance on the expectations in order to succeed.
Public law estoppel contains all the elements of private law estoppel, but with an additional appreciation of the legislative intent of the statute governing the body whose exercise of power is sought to be estopped."

Estimates range from 6,000 to 10,000 haemophiliacs in the United States becoming infected with HIV. Case was dismissed based on lack of evidence.",Appeal dismissed.,"Cory, writing for the court, held that while a commission of inquiry is not a court or tribunal and has no authority to determine legal liability (as it does not necessarily follow the same laws of evidence or procedure that a court or tribunal would observe), the primary purpose of a commission of inquiry is to make findings of fact.  A commissioner therefore has the power to make all relevant findings of fact necessary to explain or support any recommendations, even if these findings reflect adversely upon individuals.  A commissioner should, however, endeavour to avoid setting out conclusions that are couched in the specific language of criminal culpability or civil liability for the public perception may be that specific findings of criminal or civil liability have been made.  Further, a commissioner may make findings of misconduct based on the factual findings, provided that they are necessary to fulfill the purpose of the inquiry as it is described in the terms of reference. A commissioner may in addition make a finding that there has been a failure to comply with a certain standard of conduct, so long as it is clear that the standard is not a legally binding one such that the finding amounts to a conclusion of law pertaining to criminal or civil liability.
Cory held that because of the potential adverse effects of findings of fact, a commissioner must ensure that there is procedural fairness in the conduct of the inquiry.  This principle of fairness must extend to the notices of misconduct under
s. 13
.  However, if the notices are issued in confidence to the recipient, they should not be subject to as strict scrutiny as the formal findings because their purpose is to allow parties to prepare for or respond to any possible findings of misconduct. The more detail included in the notice, the greater the assistance to the party. The only possible harm would be to a party's reputation and this could not be an issue if the notices are released only to the party against whom the finding may be made. Even if the content of the notice appears to amount to a finding that would exceed the jurisdiction of the commissioner, it must be assumed that commissioners will not exceed their jurisdiction.
Applying these principles to the case at bar, Cory concludes that the Commissioner did not exceed his jurisdiction.  The potential findings were within the broad mandate given to the commission, to review and report on ""the events surrounding the contamination of the blood system in Canada in the early 1980s, by examining... the organization and effectiveness of past and current systems designed to supply blood and blood products in Canada"".  He concluded that this challenge was premature - the appellants should have waited until the release of the report and challenged the scope at that point, not based on the notices received.
Turning to the procedural protections, the appellants argued that the comments made by the Commissioner at the inquiry gave them assurances that he would not be making findings of the sort alleged in the notices; had they thought such findings would be forthcoming, they would have demanded different procedures.  Cory held that the three corporate appellants were not uninformed bystanders, but rather had full knowledge of the blood system and the tragedy under investigation, this it was not credible that they would be surprised at the critical language.  Moreover, the procedural protections granted to all the appellants were ""eminently fair"".  On the timing of the notices (they were sent out on the last day of hearings), Cory disagreed with the argument that the appellants could no longer cure the prejudice created by the notice.  The notice here was not of the type to provide a ""case to meet"" as in a criminal proceeding.  In light of the nature of the inquiry, it was impossible to give notice before all the evidence had been heard, and in this context, the late notices were not unfair.  As additional time was given for the appellants to adduce additional evidence, this did not constitute a violation of procedural fairness.","A commission of inquiry is not a court or tribunal, and has no authority to determine legal liability, and thus should endeavour to avoid setting out conclusions that are couched in the specific language of criminal culpability or civil liability.
A commissioner must ensure that there is procedural fairness in the conduct of the inquiry.
Timing of notices depends on the circumstances of the case; the more extensive and complex the evidence is, the more likely (and the more acceptable) it is that the notices will be closer to the end of the inquiry.
Notice must be given long enough before the date of the proposed hearing to give the party enough time prepare."
Janzen v Platy Enterprises Ltd.,Janzen v Platy Enterprises Ltd.[1989] 1 SCR 1252,,,1989,Supreme Court of Canada,,Canada,,,Is sexual harassment sex discrimination?,"hJanzen and Govereau both worked as waitresses at Pharos Restaurant. They were both sexually harassed by the cook, Tommy Grammas. They made it known that they thought the advances were harassing, however the harassment continued and the owners/managers made life generally hard for them at the workplace. They claim that this is discrimination on the grounds of sex and sued under the Manitoba
Human Rights Act
(now the
Human Rights Code
). The appellants were successful at the lower court, but that decision was overturned by the
Manitoba Court of Appeal
.","The courts appeal was held and was allowed. The Court of Appeal stated that harassment is not sex discrimination because the harassment of the individuals was because the two were sexually appealing, not because they were females. The court stated that sexual harassment is ""unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that detrimentally affects the work environment or leads to adverse job-related consequences for the victims of the harassment"".","The
Court of Appeal
stated that harassment is not sex discrimination because the women who were harassed were not harassed because they are women, but because they are sexually attractive. Thus, because it is not the fact that they are women that is leading to the harassment, it is not discrimination based on sex.
The Supreme Court rejects this finding.
Dickson CJ
says that sexual harassment is not about attractiveness – it is about power and its abuse. This makes the connection to gender clear – the accused used his or her power in a discriminatory way by making gender relevant when it should not be. The Court of Appeal stated that the reason why sexual harassment is not in the Manitoba Act (when it is on other legislation) is because the government didn’t want it there. Dickson rejects this as well, and states that you must make a purposive interpretation of the Act as a whole. Its purpose is to give out benefits, so it should be read broadly in order to accomplish this. The court held that sexual harassment is ""unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that detrimentally affects the work environment or leads to adverse job-related consequences for the victims of the harassment"".","Sexual harassment is sex discrimination.
Discrimination can occur against a particular subgroup – it doesn’t have to apply to all members of the group."
Mitchell v Canada (Minister of National Revenue),"Mitchell v Canada (Minister of National Revenue), 2001 SCC 33, [2001] 1 SCR 911",Minister of National Revenue,Grand Chief Michael Mitchell also known as Kanentakeron,2001,Supreme Court of Canada,"McLachlin CJ and Gonthier, Iacobucci, Major, Binnie, Arbour, and LeBel JJ",Canada,,,"How is evidence dealt with when determining if an aboriginal right exists?
Is Canadian sovereignty inconsistent with some aboriginal rights?","Mitchell was a member of the Mohawk First Nation.  He attempted to bring goods back across the border from the United States and refused to pay duty, claiming that he had an aboriginal right to trade that exempted him from having to pay duty on the goods.  The goods were intended as gifts to another First Nation as a gift of friendship.
The Crown argued that there is no aboriginal right that excludes Mitchell from having to pay duties at the border, and that even if there is it is inconsistent with Canadian sovereignty and therefore necessarily invalid.  Mitchell was successful at trial and on appeal.",Appeal allowed.,"McLachlin, writing for the majority, discusses the rules of evidence and how they relate to aboriginal rights claims, and how aboriginal rights are defined generally.
She states that in the
Van der Peet
test there are three things that you look for to help define the specific aboriginal right being claimed in a case:
the nature of the action that the appellant is claiming was done pursuant to the right;
the nature of the governmental legislation or regulation alleged to infringe the right; and
the ancestral traditions and practices relied upon to establish the right.
In this case, the aboriginal right claimed is the right to bring goods north across the St. Lawrence River (not Canada/United States border, as this did not exist when the right is claimed to have existed) for purposes of trade.
McLachlin confirms that a flexible application of the rules of evidence must be used in aboriginal cases.  This includes admitting evidence of post-contact activities to prove continuity with pre-contact practices, and meaningful consideration of oral histories.  However, this does not mandate blanket acceptance of such evidence if it potentially prejudicial, irrelevant, or unreliable.
Oral histories may be admitted for two reasons:
they may offer evidence of ancestral practices that would not otherwise be available, and;
they may provide the aboriginal perspective on the right claimed.
Again, these cannot be prejudicial and must be reliable.  Overall, the courts must interpret and weigh evidence in aboriginal cases with a consideration of the special relationship between the Crown and aboriginal peoples in light of
s. 35(1)
.  However, this does not permit a complete abandonment of the rules of evidence; particularly, aboriginal evidence should not be artificially inflated to have more weight than it can reasonably support.
In the case at bar, the evidence does not support the existence of the alleged aboriginal right.  Therefore, the claim fails on that basis – but McLachlin goes on to make clear that geographic restrictions are necessary in rights linked to specific tracts of land, like hunting and fishing cases, but they are not overly important in cases that only deal with general rights (to trade, etc.).  The geographic restriction is important in this case as it deals with the right to trade in a particular area – the border along the St. Lawrence River.  Thus, if the aboriginal right were found to exist, then the Court would have to ask if the right to trade across the St. Lawrence was integral to the Mohawk.
McLachlin is hesitant to address the Canadian sovereignty question – she says that it is better left for a case that turns on the decision.
Binnie, in a concurring judgement, discusses the sovereignty question at length.  He concludes that aboriginal people, although they have individual rights, are governed by the Canadian Constitution, and that their rights can be overruled by underlying principles such as sovereignty.  For example, no one would argue that the Mohawks continue to have their aboriginal right to raid lands in Canada with their armies, because this is contrary to Crown sovereignty.  The right in this case deals with border jurisdiction issues, which are fundamentally important to sovereignty, and overrule aboriginal rights.  As a result, even if the right was found to exist and be integral it would be overruled by Canadian sovereignty.","When defining the aboriginal right in a particular case, look to:
the nature of the action that the appellant is claiming was done pursuant to the right
the nature of the governmental legislation or regulation alleged to infringe the right
the ancestral traditions and practices relied upon to establish the right.
Rules of evidence must be flexible in aboriginal rights cases, and it should include things like post-contact histories proving continuity of practices, and oral histories, however these are only included if they are reliable and not prejudicial.
Aboriginal evidence must be interpreted and weighted with the special relationship between aboriginals and the Crown in mind.
Geographical restrictions are relevant to aboriginal rights claims dealing with rights in a particular area – such as hunting, fishing, or trading in a specific area - however they are not relevant for general rights claims – such as a right to trade generally.
Canadian Crown sovereignty can potentially act to overrule legitimate aboriginal rights that are incompatible with Crown sovereignty; aboriginals must abide by the Constitution, and sovereignty is an underlying principle of the Constitution.

John Burrows Ltd. v Subsurface Surveys Ltd.,"John Burrows Ltd. v Subsurface Surveys Ltd., [1968] SCR 607, 68 DLR (2d) 354",John Burrows Ltd.,,1968,Supreme Court of Canada,"Cartwright CJ and Judson, Ritchie, Spence, and Pigeon JJ",Canada,,,What is necessary for estoppel to apply?,"Burrows agreed to sell all of the shares in his company to Whitcomb, in the name of his corporation – Subsurface Surveys. Of the cost, $42,000 was to be a promissory note paid annually for 10 years with 6% interest.  The two were friends at the time of the deal.  Whitcomb was late on a few payments, but Burrows did not take any action.  Eventually their relationship turned sour, and when Whitcomb was late on another payment Burrows demanded the full $42,000 in payment, as per the condition in the contract stating this was the remedy for late payments.  Whitcomb claimed estoppel as defence.  Burrows was successful at trial, Whitcomb appealed and Burrows won on appeal again.",Appeal allowed.,"Ritchie, writing for the court, states that estoppel does not apply in this case.  He says that for estoppel to apply the conduct of Burrows must amount to a promise or assurance intended to alter the legal relations between the two, and that it is impossible to infer this from the facts of the case.  He was simply acting as a friend, and not entering into any negotiations with Whitcomb over new terms of payment.
Ritchie, J.: “this type of equitable defence cannot be invoked unless there is some evidence that one of the parties entered into a course of negotiation which had the effect of leading the other to suppose that the strict rights under the contract would not be enforced […] this implies that there must be evidence from which it can be inferred that the first party intended that the legal relations created by the contract would be altered as a result of the negotiations.”","In order for a promise to be capable of being relied upon and having estoppel available as a defence, it must be a promise or assurance
intended
to alter the legal relations between the two parties.
A friendly gesture is not a binding agreement, and if it is relied upon estoppel will not be available as a defence."
LMP v LS,"LMP v LS, 2011 SCC 64",LMP,LS,2011,Supreme Court of Canada,"McLachlin CJ and Binnie, LeBel, Deschamps, Abella, Rothstein and Cromwell JJ",Canada,,,Should the wife's spousal support be terminated?,"Shortly after the parties married in 1988, the wife was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.  During the marriage, the husband pursued his career while the wife looked after the household and children.  After the parties separated in 2002, they entered into a comprehensive agreement that was incorporated into a court order in 2003; the wife was to receive spousal support in the amount of $3,688/month, indexed, with no mention of a termination date. In 2007, the wife applied for increased child support.  The husband countered and brought a variation application under
s. 17 of the
Divorce Act
seeking a reduction and, ultimately, a cancellation of spousal support on the grounds that there had been a change in his financial circumstances and that the wife should seek employment.
The trial judge rejected the husband's claim that his financial circumstances had changed, but concluded that the wife was able to work outside the home.  The trial judge considered the active role of the mother, her ability to be at trial every day, and the wife's inability to demonstrate that she had been unable to find work.  As a result, an order was made reducing, then terminating her spousal support as of August 2010.  There was no mention of a material change of circumstances.
The Court of Appeal rejected the wife's appeal, concluding that her failure to become self-sufficient over time gave rise to a material change in circumstances. She had not looked for work in four years, so spousal support should terminate.  The wife was concerned that looking for work would disentitle her to the disability she was receiving.",Appeal allowed; original order restored.,"Abella and Rothstein, writing for the majority, say that s. 17 arrangements exist because separating spouses have an impaired ability to realistically and objectively assess their future needs, due to the emotions surrounding separation/divorce.  There is some dispute about this; the traditional view of s. 17 is that it prevents the parties from having to predict their long-term situation.  They discuss the purpose of support agreements being about apportioning risk and achieving finality and certainty.
The
Divorce Act
authorizes courts to vary spousal support terms either on an initial application for support under s. 15.2, or on an application to vary an existing court order under s. 17.  For initial applications for support (variations to support agreements or interim orders) brought under
s. 15.2(4)
, the court must consider the length of cohabitation, the functions of the spouses in the relationship, and any agreement or arrangement related to spousal support, whether formal or informal.  For variations under
s. 17(4.1)
, the court must consider the conditions, means, and needs of the other spouse and other circumstances, with no mention of prior arrangements.  Abella and Rothstein hold these are two fundamentally different processes; you cannot import one set of considerations into the other, however if there was an agreement, it is still relevant to a consideration of a material change under s. 17 as this will inform whether a material change exists.
The correct test, in the opinion of the majority, is that from
Willick
: a court must be satisfied that there has been a material change in circumstances since the making of the prior order or variation, meaning a change that, ""if known at the time, would likely have resulted in different terms"".
Applying this to the case at bar, they find that the trial judge erred in conducting a
de novo
hearing on the issue of the wife's ability to work, and thus in concluding that she should become economically self-sufficient without making a finding about whether there had been a material change in the wife's circumstances since the 2003 order.  The Court of Appeal also erred in determining that the wife had the capacity to work, and that this, coupled with the passage of time, amounted to a material change of circumstances.  Upon examination of the actual circumstances of the parties at the time the order was made and the terms of the order, it is apparent that there has been no material change of circumstances since the making of the order and that there was therefore no basis on which to vary it under
s. 17(4.1)
.  At the time of the order, the wife had multiple sclerosis and was not expected to seek employment outside the home, and there has been no material change since that time.
The support agreement contained a provision stating ""[t]his agreement is full and final"".  The majority held that this remains subject to variation under s. 17, if a material change in circumstances arises.
Cromwell, agreeing in the result, disagrees with the analysis of the majority.  He held that the decision of the court in
Miglin
, dealing with an initial support order under s. 15.2, provided the framework for variations under s. 17.  The broad language of 
conditions, means, and needs of the spouse necessarily contained a consideration of the length of cohabitation, functions, orders, etc.","Test for variations under s. 17 of the

A fire extinguisher was used, which completely put out the fire and no one was injured.  However, the extinguisher made a noise that caused one of the patrons in the restaurant to shout out that there was a gas leak and that there was going to be an explosion.  Chaos ensued, and the Bradfords were injured in the havoc and sued for damages.  The Bradfords were successful at trial, but this was overturned on appeal.",Appeal dismissed.,"Martland, writing for the majority, states that it is very clear that the injury resulted from the hysterical conduct of a customer that was in reaction to the fire extinguisher performing its proper function.  The negligent act was allowing too much grease to build up on the grill but the respondents had discharged their burden of care by having the extinguisher present.  This outcome cannot reasonably be seen as a consequence created by allowing too much grease to build up, and therefore Kanellos should not be liable.
Spence, in the dissent, says that the panic could have been foreseen.  It was foreseeable that the buildup of grease would necessitate the use of the extinguisher, and it is reasonable that the noise of the extinguisher would cause the hysteria, and further it is reasonable that the hysteria would result in injury.  He says that it is ""human nature"" to react this way in such circumstances.","Canada employs the
Wagon Mound
test.
When there are measures in place to eliminate potential injuries from negligent acts, and they work properly in eliminating the risk when such an act occurs then improbable outcomes resulting from the correct employment of the measure cannot be attributed to the original negligent act."

If so, are the police guilty of it?","Hill was investigated by the police, arrested, tried, wrongfully convicted, and ultimately acquitted after spending more than 20 months in jail for a crime he did not commit.  Police officers suspected that Hill had committed 10 robberies. The evidence against Hill included a tip, a police officer's photo identification of Hill, eyewitness identifications, a potential sighting of Hill near the site of one of the robberies, and witness statements that the robber was Indigenous.  During their investigation, the police released Hill's photo to the media.  They also asked witnesses to identify the robber from a photo lineup consisting of Hill, who is an Indigenous person, and 11 similar-looking Caucasian foils.  The police, however, also had information that two Latino men, one of whom looks like Hill, were the robbers. Two similar robberies occurred while Hill was in custody.  Hill was charged with 10 counts of robbery but 9 charges were withdrawn before trial.  Hill was found guilty of robbery. He appealed and a new trial was ordered where he was acquitted and brought a civil action that included a claim in negligence against the police based on the conduct of their investigation.  The trial judge dismissed the claim in negligence, but the Court of Appeal unanimously recognized the tort of negligent investigation, however a majority of the court held that the police were not negligent in their investigation.  Hill appealed on the fact that the police were not found to be negligent, and the police cross-appealed on the finding of a tort of negligent investigation.",Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed.,"McLachlin, writing for the majority, held that the tort of negligent investigation exists in Canada. In the relationship between an investigating police officer and a suspect, the requirement of reasonable foreseeability was clearly made out and posed no barrier to finding a duty of care.  A clearly negligent police investigation of a suspect could cause harm to a suspect.  There is sufficient proximity between a police officer and a suspect, as the relationship between the parties was personal, close and direct, thereby giving rise to a
prima facie
duty of care.  Further, there were no broad policy reasons for declining to recognize a duty of care owed by the police to a suspect. The respondent police officers owed a duty of care to Hill, which required them to meet the standard of a reasonable officer in similar circumstances.  While she held that the investigation that led to Hill's arrest and conviction was flawed, it did not breach this standard.",There is a tort of negligent investigation in Canada.

The court held that Bell did not provide sufficient evidence for their claims and also because they misunderstand impartiality - it does not mean having the freedom to decide a case however one wishes to, being subject to certain binding principles is perfectly legitimate for an impartial judiciary.  Further, the Commission cannot create guidelines that favour them in the Tribunal, because to do so would be

While in the 27th week of pregnancy she was driving her car when her negligent actions caused a car accident.  The fetus was permanently injured, and was born prematurely that day.  Her son, Ryan Dobson, suffered physical and mental injuries, including cerebral palsy.  His grandfather launched a tort claim for damages against his mother.  Ryan was successful at the Court of Appeal, which his mother appealed.",Appeal allowed.,"Cory, writing for the majority, finds that the mother should not be held liable in the situation because of the policy implications.  They employ the
Kamloops
test to determine if a duty of care should be owed.  It has two parts:
Is the relationship between the two parties close enough to create a reasonable duty?
Are there any public policy implications that should negate or limit the scope of the duty?
They find that the first part is satisfied; however the public policy implications negate the duty.  They state that there are two main reasons for this: it would violate the privacy and autonomy of women, and it is impossible to judicially define a reasonable standard of conduct for pregnant women.
McLachlin, in a concurring judgment, states that another main reason why this duty cannot be imposed is that it would violate pregnant women's rights under the
Charter
– specifically liberty and equality.  They would lose their liberty, and not be treated equally with other women in society.
Major, in the dissent, states that in order for the public policy implications to negate the duty they must add new restrictions on what the woman can do.  He says that this is not the case, because she had a duty of care to everyone else on the road, and extending that to the foetus would not change the reasonable standard of her conduct.  He says that this case deals specifically with pregnant women driving automobiles, and if the creation of duty imposed a limitation on her actions that was not there previously then the outcome would be different.  He uses the example with another pregnant woman in the car – if the same outcome occurred, then there is no question that the other woman's foetus could sue her for negligence.  He agrees that the
Kamloops
test applies, but says that the policy implications here do not negate the duty.","Pregnant women do not owe a duty of care to the foetus in their womb.

The claimant had this condition but had driven flawlessly at work and on public roads using ""prism glasses"".  Despite this he was refused individual assessment and was not allowed to receive a license and was therefore unable to complete his job.  The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal allowed Grismer to be individually tested.  Grismer died shortly after this decision.  This was upheld by the British Columbia Supreme Court but overruled by the Court of Appeal.","Appeal allowed, standard disallowed.","The court applies the
Meiorin
test, showing that it can be used in scenarios outside of the workplace to determine if discrimination is justified.  This case passes the first part because the purpose of the standard (reasonable safety) is rationally connected to the function (issuing drivers’ licenses).  It also passes the second step because there is no evidence that the standard (no licenses for HH sufferers) was adopted for any reasons other than road safety.  However the case fails the third step as the court finds that the standard (no licenses for HH) is not reasonably necessary for the purpose (reasonable safety).  The blanket prohibition doesn't let people even attempt to show that they can drive safely.
It is clear here that the accommodation would be to allow testing.  In order to succeed the government would have had to prove that to allow testing would result to undue hardship which they failed to do.  Although there are clearly safety and cost concerns involved with testing, the government didn't put in any effort to determine these values, nor did they even look for alternative ways of testing.  The court also says that in general, with the government, costs must be exorbitant to amount to undue hardship, as they are publicly funded and this would be seen as being in the public interest.  As the standard is not rationally necessary for the purpose of reasonable road safety, it amounts to discrimination and must be removed.","The
Meiorin
test applies to all standards that are thought to be discriminatory, even if they do not occur in a workplace; called bona fide justification tests.

During the period in which the bond was in place, one of Gordon's employees was involved in fraudulent activity with customers.  The activity was discovered in the summer of 1991 and an investigation was commenced. Due to the complexity of the matter, Guarantee Co. agreed to postpone the filing of a proof of loss until March 1992.  The eventual proof of loss claimed a loss of more than $42 million.  On August 5, Guarantee Co. responded to the proof of loss, stating that due to material misrepresentations made by the firm, the bond was being rescinded.  It refunded the premium paid under the bond, but Gordon refused to accept it.  On July 15, 1993, Gordon issued a claim against Guarantee Co. in Quebec.  A week later, it commenced action in Ontario.  Guarantee Co. submitted that the Ontario action was started more that two years after the discovery of the loss.",Appeal allowed.,"On dealing with the issue of rescission, Iacobucci and Bastarache hold that rescission is a remedy available to the representee when the other party has made a false or misleading representation.  Repudiation, by contrast, occurs by words or conduct evincing an intention not to be bound by the contract.  Contrary to rescission, which allows the rescinding party to treat the contract as if it were void, the effect of repudiation depends on the election made by the non-repudiating party.  If the non-repudiating party accepts the repudiation, the contract is terminated, and the parties are discharged from future obligations, although rights and obligations that have already matured are not extinguished.  If the repudiation is not accepted, the contract remains in being for the future and each party has the right to sue for damages for past or future breaches.  The held that courts must be sensitive to the potential for misuse of the term rescission and must analyse the entire context of the contract and give effect, where possible, to the parties' intent.  In this case, the misrepresentation was a term of the contract, thus rescission will be available if the misrepresentation is ""substantial"", ""material"" or ""goes to the root of the contract"". Here the bond specifically provided that misrepresentations of ""material fact"" would be grounds for rescission.  As the parties are sophisticated actors, it is appropriate to give effect to their intent as expressed in the plain words of the contract.  The appellant's attempt to effect a restitution of the premiums paid by the respondent confirms that ""rescission"" is appropriately used in the bond.",Rescission is available when a misrepresentation is substantial/material/goes to the root of the contract.
Blencoe v British Columbia (Human Rights Commission),"Blencoe v British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), 2000 SCC 44",,Robin Blencoe,2000,Supreme Court of Canada,"McLachlin CJ and L'Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier, Iacobucci, Major, Bastarache, Binnie, Arbour, and LeBel JJ",Canada,,,"Did the delay in the tribunal hearing violate Blencoe's
s.7
rights or the administrative law rule against undue delay?","Robin Blencoe was a minister of the British Columbia government for several years when Fran Yanor went public with a claim of sexual harassment and filed to the British Columbia Human Rights Council (later the British Columbia Human Rights Commission). Several months later 9 other women filed complaints for sexual harassment.  Due to delays to the tribunal hearings the claims were not resolved for 11 years after the first filing in 1995.  During this time Blencoe was subjected to vast media coverage that contributed to the ruin of his career, and to his and his family's social and psychological hardship.  Blencoe challenged the delay of the Human Rights Commission in the British Columbia Supreme Court on the basis of denial of natural justice. The court dismissed his challenge.  Blencoe appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal on the basis that the delay of the hearing for over 30 months was a violation of his right to ""security of person"" under
s.7 of the
Charter
. The Court found in favour of Blencoe and ordered the charges against him to be stayed, holding that the delay stigmatized him and caused undue harm to him and his family.","Appeal allowed, tribunal hearing to proceed.","Bastarache, writing for the majority, held that in analyzing
s.7
there are two steps:
it must be determined if there has been a violation of life, liberty, or security of person,
the violation must be shown to be contrary to the principles of fundamental justice.
As there was clearly no violation of ""life"" here, it was not discussed.
""Liberty"" is broader than simply protection against physical restraint.  “Liberty” is engaged where state compulsions or prohibitions affect important and fundamental life choices.  This threshold was not passed in this case, as the delays did not prevent Blencoe from making fundamental life choices.
""Security of the person"" is engaged where the state interferes with bodily integrity or there is serious state-imposed psychological stress.  This protects both the physical and psychological security of the individual.  There are two requirements for psychological stress (which was claimed in this case) to pass the threshold:
it must be state-imposed, i.e. the hardship must be result from the state's actions; and
it must be serious.
In this case, the state did not cause Blencoe's stress – the media did.  Although the Commission might have created some stress, the media covering the story created the majority of it before the human rights complaints were filed.  This means that the s. 7 threshold was not passed.
The court goes on to state that dignity, personal reputation and stigma are not separate rights protected by s. 7; although they are considered when looking for a s. 7 breach, they are not determinative – they are not self-standing rights protected by s. 7.
Bastarache dismissed the possibility that the trial was not fair as there was no evidence to suggest that Blencoe was not able to provide a full answer and defence.
The court found that the harm only amounted to personal hardship and was not serious.  On whether the delay violated natural justice by bringing the Human Rights Commission into disrepute, the court noted that many of the delays were contributed to by Blencoe or consented to by him.  Consequently, the Commission was not brought into disrepute.
He concludes that the
Charter
definitely applies to the actions of the members of the Human Rights Commission.  Although they perform a function that is judicial in nature, they are administrators who have their power granted solely by the will of the government.  Therefore, simply because the Commission is not technically ""controlled"" by government does not mean that the actions of its members will not be subject to the
Charter
.  Their authority is completely derived from the
Human Rights Code
, which is government legislation, and therefore they are carrying out actions relegated to them by the government – meaning that they are subject to the
Charter
.
LeBel, in the dissent, held that there was a violation of administrative law, but did not consider this to be a
Charter
issue.","In order to claim procedural fairness as protected by the
Charter
:
there must be a violation of life, liberty, or security of person; and
the violation must be shown to be contrary to the principles of fundamental justice.
To violate “liberty”, the claimant must show that state compulsions or prohibitions have affected important and fundamental life choices.
To violate “security of the person” the claimant must show that the state has interfered with his or her bodily integrity, or that there is
serious
state-imposed psychological stress.
Dignity, personal reputation and stigma are not standalone rights protected by section 7.

s. 4 of the
Federal Child Support Guidelines
?","Parties married in 1979.  At that time, father was a lawyer and mother was a teacher.  Parties initially intended that mother would stay home for one year following the birth of the second child and then return to teaching on a part-time basis.  In 1985, five days after the second child was born, parties separated.  At the time of trial, mother was earning $63,000/year, and father, $945,538, with net worth valued at $78m.  The father had been paying $30,000/year in child support.  In 1988, the mother applied for an increase in child support.  The husband failed to file a timely financial statement and the trial judge found it inappropriate for father to pay the table amount applicable to his income level, ordering him to pay $10,034/month plus discretionary expenses.  The husband appealed.",Appeal dismissed.,"Bastarache, writing for the court, held that ""inappropriate"" means unsuitable regards to the means, needs and circumstances of the children and the financial capability of the spouse, and thus the amount can be either too low or too high.  Both fairness and flexibility are stressed as important considerations under s. 4.  There does exist a strong presumption in favour of the table amount, hence the party who is seeking a deviation from that amount has the onus of demonstrating the amount is inappropriate.  Paying parents seeking variation must demonstrate that budgeted child expenses are so high as to ""exceed the generous ambit within which reasonable disagreement is possible"".  Bastarache states there must be ""clear and convincing evidence"" for deviation.  Only after examining all the circumstances of the case, including the facts expressly listed in s. 4(b)(ii) should courts find table amounts to be inappropriate and craft more suitable child support awards.  While children can expect a ""fair additional amount"" beyond the first $150,000 table amount, there should be no redistribution of wealth to provide spousal support, though he recognizes the inevitability that some child support will benefit the custodial parent.
In the case at bar, the trial judge correctly considered all the factors and thus correctly exercised their discretion, leaving no basis for an appeal.","There is a strong presumption in favour of the table amount; the onus is on the party seeking to deviate to show clear, convincing evidence why the table amount is inappropriate.

The husband was the primary wage earner and she stayed home with their seven kids.  When they separated they agreed the husband was going to keep his pension and the wife was going to keep the matrimonial home, an approximate even split.  The husband was to pay spousal support of $3,200/month.  Six years later, after remarriage, the husband retired and began collecting his pension of ~$8,000/month.  Of the $8,000 around $2,300 was earned after separation while $5,700 was earned during the marriage. The wife had prudently invested her share of the matrimonial property.  The husband applied to have the support reduced because he his pension had already been divided and the payment of support would constitute double dipping.  The motions judge accepted the husband's position, and reduced the amount of monthly support from $3,433.12, indexed, to $950, unindexed. The Court of Appeal raised this amount to $2,000/month, indexed to the cost of living. The husband appealed from this decision.",Appeal allowed.,"The majority of the court held that it would not be fair to divide the property and then expect one spouse to support the other with their share of the divided property.  Both spouses are obligated to use their property reasonably to maintain themselves in their retirement.  When spousal support plays a compensatory role on marriage breakdown, it may be unreasonable to expect the payee spouse to generate investment income from the matrimonial home, as the ability to remain in it usually assists the payee spouse and children to maintain their previous lifestyle. When support is based on need, different considerations apply, so that where the value of the family home has become disproportionate to the means of the parties, equity may require that it be sold and replaced appropriately.","As a general rule, any property that has already been divided should be excluded from a person's means to avoid double dipping.
Despite the inequity of double dipping, because non-compensatory support is need based, it cannot always be avoided.
Both spouses have a duty to reasonably use their property to maintain themselves; after retirement, they must do so in a capital-depleting manner - they must draw on savings to support themselves after retirement.
If a spouse (payor or recipient) does not reasonably use their assets to generate income, income can be imputed to them.

Less than two years later, they married.  A child was born arising from their relationship, and the wife brought to the relationship a child from a previous relationship.  The husband played an active role in caring for both children and was a father figure to his wife's daughter. In 1992 the parties separate and in 1994, in a consent judgment, the husband acknowledged both children as children of the marriage and was granted access to them.  In 1995, the wife commenced divorce proceedings.  She included in her claim the request for a declaration that husband stood in the place of a parent to her daughter, which the husband contested.  There had been some discussion of formal adoption, but it had never taken place.  At trial, it was found that husband had repudiated his parental relationship and therefore he was not required to contribute any support for her.  The trial judge found that it was abundantly clear in Manitoba trust and family law that the spouse standing in the place of a parent, having voluntarily assumed that role, had the right to withdraw unilaterally from that role.  On appeal, it was also noted that the right of a person to terminate a relationship in which he or she stood in the place of a parent was well settled in Manitoba and that the court was bound by a previous decision.",,"Bastarache, writing for the court, held that what needs to be determined is the nature of the relationship from an objectivesdsd perspective, i.e. what would a reasonable person think the status of these people is to one another?  It had been argued that it should be from the perspective of the child, but this was rejected as impractical.
The following factors should be considered in this assessment:
Intention
: both those expressed formally and inferred from conduct.
A step parent cannot contract out of an
in loco parentis
relationship from the onset.
Participation in the extended family
: does the child participate in the extended family in the same way as would a biological child?
Financial support
: Does the stepparent provide financially for the child?
Discipline
: Does the person discipline the child?
Holding out
: Does the person represent to the child/the family/the world, either explicitly or implicitly, that he or she is responsible as a parent to the child?
Role of biological parent
: What is the nature or existence of the child’s relationship with the non-custodial biological parent?
If the biological parent has an active role in the child’s life, this militates against a finding of
in loco parentis
.
A step parent cannot contract out of an
in loco parentis
relationship from the onset.
If the biological parent has an active role in the child’s life, this militates against a finding of
in loco parentis
.
Note that the rights go both ways; a person
in loco parentis
can apply for custody.
Applying this to the case at bar, it is clear that the stepfather stood in the place of a parent to Jessica; he represented to Jessica and the world that he assumed full parental responsibility for her.  He was the only father she had ever known, and the parties led her to believe he was her biological father.  After the separation he continued his visits with Jessica until his access was terminated with both girls.","Test for a parent to stand
in loco parentis
.
There are several criticisms of this decision in the academic literature.
This ruling may have a chilling effect on stepparent relationships with children as it encourages stepparents to keep their distance in fear they will have a lifelong obligation to the child.
In the era of serial relationships, a custodial parent may receive support from a biological parent and a string of step parents; where should this end?
Some have critiqued the threshold as being too low; short relationships can result in a finding of
in loco parentis
.  This is the broadest stepparent obligation in the common law world.
The bulk of Supreme Court jurisprudence in family law emphasizes the importance of choice in family law and the role of personal choice in family life, yet this case specifically places obligations on stepparents who have chosen not to adopt the child.
This demonstrates the importance of ""best interests of the child"" in this, as in every other, area of family law.

Murdoch v Murdoch,"Murdoch v Murdoch(1973), 41 DLR (3d) 367",Irene Florence Murdoch,James Alexander Murdoch,1973,Supreme Court of Canada,"Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Spence, and Laskin JJ",Canada,,,Do wives have any interest in matrimonial homes?,,Appeal dismissed.,"Martland, writing for the majority, finds that the wife's labor was not beyond what is ordinarily required of a ranch wife, and therefore this does not grant her any special interest in the land. They say that the only way she could have any interest in it is if a resulting trust was created. However, this could only have been created if she helped to pay for the property, or if there was a common intention at the time of the purchase to create a trust for her half of the interest, even though title was in her husband's name. The majority find that she did not help pay, and that there was no common intention. Therefore, there could be no resulting trust and the wife had no property in the land that she had worked on for 25 years.
In the dissent, Laskin claimed that the court did not need to examine the intentions of the parties to create a trust. He says that the court has the ability to create constructive trusts to prevent unjust enrichment – this is a power afforded in equity. He states that it is clear here that the wife contributed heavily to the property, and that the husband benefited on her behalf – therefore the court should construct a trust that would allow her to benefit in proportion to her contributions.","Resulting trusts can only be created when two parties both pay at the time of purchase, despite title only being registered in one of their names, or when there is a common intention at the time to create a trust interest for the party whose name is not registered.
Laskin's ideas about constructive trusts were eventually adopted by the Court, however they were only dissenting opinions in this case."

The sidewalk is private and owned by the shopping mall. She started picketing on a city sidewalk, but it was too far from the store so she moved to the mall property.

There is no such statute in this case, and thus the case must be found on the common law bill of rights, which states that private property is the most important thing to be protected at common law.
In the dissent
Laskin CJ
questions the underlying issues, and says that the common law must be updated to take new phenomena into consideration. There were no such things as shopping centres like the ones today when the common law developed. These malls are essentially public places – the owners invite all members of the public virtually without restriction. Therefore there must be a significant grievance to expel someone from the property, which he does not think happens here.",Sufficient control and possession of a property is needed to establish an intention to exclude an individual from a shopping centre.
